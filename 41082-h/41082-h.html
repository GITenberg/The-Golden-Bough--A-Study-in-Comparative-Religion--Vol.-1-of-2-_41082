        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some time I
        have been preparing a general work on primitive superstition and
        religion. Among the problems which had attracted my attention was the
        hitherto unexplained rule of the Arician priesthood; and last spring
        it happened that in the course of my reading I came across some facts
        which, combined with others I had noted before, suggested an
        explanation of the rule in question. As the explanation, if correct,
        promised to throw light on some obscure features of primitive
        religion, I resolved to develop it fully, and, detaching it from my
        general work, to issue it as a separate study. This book is the
        result.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now that the
        theory, which necessarily presented itself to me at first in outline,
        has been worked out in detail, I cannot but feel that in some places
        I may have pushed it too far. If this should prove to have been the
        case, I will readily acknowledge and retract my error as soon as it
        is brought home to me. Meantime my essay may serve its purpose as a
        first attempt to solve a difficult problem, and to bring a variety of
        scattered facts into some sort of order and system.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A justification is
        perhaps needed of the length at which I have dwelt upon the popular
        festivals observed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg
        viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        by European peasants in spring, at midsummer, and at harvest. It can
        hardly be too often repeated, since it is not yet generally
        recognised, that in spite of their fragmentary character the popular
        superstitions and customs of the peasantry are by far the fullest and
        most trustworthy evidence we possess as to the primitive religion of
        the Aryans. Indeed the primitive Aryan, in all that regards his
        mental fibre and texture, is not extinct. He is amongst us to this
        day. The great intellectual and moral forces which have
        revolutionised the educated world have scarcely affected the peasant.
        In his inmost beliefs he is what his forefathers were in the days
        when forest trees still grew and squirrels played on the ground where
        Rome and London now stand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence every
        inquiry into the primitive religion of the Aryans should either start
        from the superstitious beliefs and observances of the peasantry, or
        should at least be constantly checked and controlled by reference to
        them. Compared with the evidence afforded by living tradition, the
        testimony of ancient books on the subject of early religion is worth
        very little. For literature accelerates the advance of thought at a
        rate which leaves the slow progress of opinion by word of mouth at an
        immeasurable distance behind. Two or three generations of literature
        may do more to change thought than two or three thousand years of
        traditional life. But the mass of the people who do not read books
        remain unaffected by the mental revolution wrought by literature; and
        so it has come about that in Europe at the present day the
        superstitious beliefs and practices which have been handed
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id=
        "Pgix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> down by word of mouth are
        generally of a far more archaic type than the religion depicted in
        the most ancient literature of the Aryan race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is on these
        grounds that, in discussing the meaning and origin of an ancient
        Italian priesthood, I have devoted so much attention to the popular
        customs and superstitions of modern Europe. In this part of my
        subject I have made great use of the works of the late W. Mannhardt,
        without which, indeed, my book could scarcely have been written.
        Fully recognising the truth of the principles which I have
        imperfectly stated, Mannhardt set himself systematically to collect,
        compare, and explain the living superstitions of the peasantry. Of
        this wide field the special department which he marked out for
        himself was the religion of the woodman and the farmer, in other
        words, the superstitious beliefs and rites connected with trees and
        cultivated plants. By oral inquiry, and by printed questions
        scattered broadcast over Europe, as well as by ransacking the
        literature of folk-lore, he collected a mass of evidence, part of
        which he published in a series of admirable works. But his health,
        always feeble, broke down before he could complete the comprehensive
        and really vast scheme which he had planned, and at his too early
        death much of his precious materials remained unpublished. His
        manuscripts are now deposited in the University Library at Berlin,
        and in the interest of the study to which he devoted his life it is
        greatly to be desired that they should be examined, and that such
        portions of them as he has not utilised in his books should be given
        to the world.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg
        x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of his published
        works the most important are, first, two tracts, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roggenwolf und
        Roggenhund</span></span>, Danzig 1865 (second edition, Danzig, 1866),
        and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die
        Korndämonen</span></span>, Berlin, 1868. These little works were put
        forward by him tentatively, in the hope of exciting interest in his
        inquiries and thereby securing the help of others in pursuing them.
        But, except from a few learned societies, they met with very little
        attention. Undeterred by the cold reception accorded to his efforts
        he worked steadily on, and in 1875 published his chief work,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Der
        Baumkultus der Germanen und ihrer Nachbarstämme</span></span>. This
        was followed in 1877 by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Antike Wald- und Feldkulte</span></span>. His
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mythologische Forschungen</span></span>, a
        posthumous work, appeared in 1884.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1"
        href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much as I owe to
        Mannhardt, I owe still more to my friend Professor W. Robertson
        Smith. My interest in the early history of society was first excited
        by the works of Dr. E. B. Tylor, which opened up a mental vista
        undreamed of by me before. But it is a long step from a lively
        interest in a subject to a systematic study of it; and that I took
        this step is due to the influence of my friend W. Robertson Smith.
        The debt which I owe to the vast stores of his knowledge, the
        abundance and fertility of his ideas, and his unwearied kindness, can
        scarcely be overestimated. Those who know his writings may form some,
        though a very inadequate, conception of the extent to which I have
        been influenced by him. The views of sacrifice set forth in his
        article <span class="tei tei-q">“Sacrifice”</span> in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Encyclopaedia</span> <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Britannica</span></span>, and further developed
        in his recent work, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Religion of the Semites</span></span>, mark
        a new departure in the historical study of religion, and ample traces
        of them will be found in this book. Indeed the central idea of my
        essay—the conception of the slain god—is derived directly, I believe,
        from my friend. But it is due to him to add that he is in no way
        responsible for the general explanation which I have offered of the
        custom of slaying the god. He has read the greater part of the proofs
        in circumstances which enhanced the kindness, and has made many
        valuable suggestions which I have usually adopted; but except where
        he is cited by name, or where the views expressed coincide with those
        of his published works, he is not to be regarded as necessarily
        assenting to any of the theories propounded in this book.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The works of
        Professor G. A. Wilken of Leyden have been of great service in
        directing me to the best original authorities on the Dutch East
        Indies, a very important field to the ethnologist. To the courtesy of
        the Rev. Walter Gregor, M.A., of Pitsligo, I am indebted for some
        interesting communications which will be found acknowledged in their
        proper places. Mr. Francis Darwin has kindly allowed me to consult
        him on some botanical questions. The manuscript authorities to which
        I occasionally refer are answers to a list of ethnological questions
        which I am circulating. Most of them will, I hope, be published in
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal

          know Turner's picture of the Golden Bough? The scene, suffused with
          the golden glow of imagination in which the divine mind of Turner
          steeped and transfigured even the fairest natural landscape, is a
          dream-like vision of the little woodland lake of Nemi, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Diana's Mirror,”</span> as it was called by the
          ancients. No one who has seen that calm water, lapped in a green
          hollow of the Alban hills, can ever forget it. The two
          characteristic Italian villages which slumber on its banks, and the
          equally Italian palazzo whose terraced gardens descend steeply to
          the lake, hardly break the stillness and even the solitariness of
          the scene. Dian herself might still linger by this lonely shore,
          still haunt these woodlands wild.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In antiquity
          this sylvan landscape was the scene of a strange and recurring
          tragedy. On the northern shore of the lake, right under the
          precipitous cliffs on which the modern village of Nemi is perched,
          stood the sacred grove and sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis, or Diana
          of the Wood.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
          "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> The
          lake and the grove were sometimes known as the lake and grove of
          Aricia.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
          "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> But the
          town of Aricia (the modern La Riccia) was situated about three
          miles off, at the foot of the Alban Mount, and separated by a steep
          descent from the lake, which lies in a small crater-like hollow on
          the mountain side. In this sacred grove there grew a certain tree
          round which at any time of the day and probably far into the night
          a strange figure might be seen to prowl. In his hand he carried a
          drawn sword, and he kept peering warily about him as if every
          instant he expected to be set upon by an enemy.<a id="noteref_4"
          name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> He was
          a priest and a murderer; and the man for whom he looked was sooner
          or later to murder him and hold the priesthood in his stead. Such
          was the rule of the sanctuary. A candidate for the priesthood could
          only succeed to office by slaying the priest, and having slain him
          he held office till he was himself slain by a stronger or a
          craftier.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This strange
          rule has no parallel in classical antiquity, and cannot be
          explained from it. To find an explanation we must go farther
          afield. No one will probably deny that such a custom savours of a
          barbarous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
          003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          age and, surviving into imperial times, stands out in striking
          isolation from the polished Italian society of the day, like a
          primeval rock rising from a smooth-shaven lawn. It is the very
          rudeness and barbarity of the custom which allow us a hope of
          explaining it. For recent researches into the early history of man
          have revealed the essential similarity with which, under many
          superficial differences, the human mind has elaborated its first
          crude philosophy of life. Accordingly if we can show that a
          barbarous custom, like that of the priesthood of Nemi, has existed
          elsewhere; if we can detect the motives which led to its
          institution; if we can prove that these motives have operated
          widely, perhaps universally, in human society, producing in varied
          circumstances a variety of institutions specifically different but
          generically alike; if we can show, lastly, that these very motives,
          with some of their derivative institutions, were actually at work
          in classical antiquity; then we may fairly infer that at a remoter
          age the same motives gave birth to the priesthood of Nemi. Such an
          inference, in default of direct evidence as to how the priesthood
          did actually arise, can never amount to demonstration. But it will
          be more or less probable according to the degree of completeness
          with which it fulfils the conditions indicated above. The object of
          this book is, by meeting these conditions, to offer a fairly
          probable explanation of the priesthood of Nemi.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I begin by
          setting forth the few facts and legends which have come down to us
          on the subject. According to one story the worship of Diana at Nemi
          was instituted by Orestes, who, after killing Thoas, King of the
          Tauric Chersonese (the Crimea), fled with his sister to Italy,
          bringing with him the image of the Tauric Diana. The bloody ritual
          which legend ascribed to that goddess <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is familiar to classical readers; it is said
          that every stranger who landed on the shore was sacrificed on her
          altar. But transported to Italy, the rite assumed a milder form.
          Within the sanctuary at Nemi grew a certain tree of which no branch
          might be broken. Only a runaway slave was allowed to break off, if
          he could, one of its boughs. Success in the attempt entitled him to
          fight the priest in single combat, and if he slew him he reigned in
          his stead with the title of King of the Wood (<span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Rex Nemorensis</span></span>). Tradition
          averred that the fateful branch was that Golden Bough which, at the
          Sibyl's bidding, Aeneas plucked before he essayed the perilous
          journey to the world of the dead. The flight of the slave
          represented, it was said, the flight of Orestes; his combat with
          the priest was a reminiscence of the human sacrifices once offered
          to the Tauric Diana. This rule of succession by the sword was
          observed down to imperial times; for amongst his other freaks
          Caligula, thinking that the priest of Nemi had held office too
          long, hired a more stalwart ruffian to slay him.<a id="noteref_5"
          name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the worship
          of Diana at Nemi two leading features can still be made out. First,
          from the votive-offerings found in modern times on the site, it
          appears that she was especially worshipped by women desirous of
          children or of an easy delivery.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6"
          href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          fire seems <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg
          005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to have played a foremost part in her ritual. For during her annual
          festival, celebrated at the hottest time of the year, her grove was
          lit up by a multitude of torches, whose ruddy glare was reflected
          by the waters of the lake; and throughout the length and breadth of
          Italy the day was kept with holy rites at every domestic
          hearth.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=
          "#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
          Moreover, women whose prayers had been heard by the goddess brought
          lighted torches to the grove in fulfilment of their vows.<a id=
          "noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class=

          the title of Vesta borne by the Arician Diana<a id="noteref_9"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> points
          almost certainly to the maintenance of a perpetual holy fire in her
          sanctuary.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At her annual
          festival all young people went through a purificatory ceremony in
          her honour; dogs were crowned; and the feast consisted of a young
          kid, wine, and cakes, served up piping hot on platters of
          leaves.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=

          not reign alone in her grove at Nemi. Two lesser divinities shared
          her forest sanctuary. One was Egeria, the nymph of the clear water
          which, bubbling from the basaltic rocks, used to fall in graceful
          cascades into the lake at the place called Le Mole.<a id=

          According to one story the grove was first consecrated to Diana by
          a Manius Egerius, who was the ancestor of a long and distinguished
          line. Hence the proverb <span class="tei tei-q">“There are many
          Manii at Ariciae.”</span> Others explained the proverb very
          differently. They said it meant that there were a great many ugly
          and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name=

          they referred to the word <span class=

          which meant a bogey or bugbear to frighten children.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other of
          these minor deities was Virbius. Legend had it that Virbius was the
          youthful Greek hero Hippolytus, who had been killed by his horses
          on the sea-shore of the Saronic Gulf. Him, to please Diana, the
          leech Aesculapius brought to life again by his simples. But
          Jupiter, indignant that a mortal man should return from the gates
          of death, thrust down the meddling leech himself to Hades; and
          Diana, for the love she bore Hippolytus, carried him away to Italy
          and hid him from the angry god in the dells of Nemi, where he
          reigned a forest king under the name of Virbius. Horses were
          excluded from the grove and sanctuary, because horses had killed
          Hippolytus.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=

          the facts and theories bequeathed to us by antiquity on the subject
          of the priesthood of Nemi. From materials so slight and scanty it
          is impossible to extract a solution of the problem. It remains to
          try whether the survey of a wider field may not yield us the clue
          we seek. The questions to be answered are two: first, why had the
          priest to slay his predecessor? and second, why, before he slew
          him, had he to pluck the Golden Bough? The rest of this book will

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The union of a
          royal title with priestly duties was common in ancient Italy and
          Greece. At Rome and in other Italian cities there was a priest
          called the Sacrificial King or King of the Sacred Rites
          (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

          republican Athens the second magistrate of the state was called the

          "#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          other Greek democracies had titular kings, whose duties, so far as

          Rome the tradition was that the Sacrificial King had been appointed
          after the expulsion of the kings in order to offer the sacrifices
          which had been previously offered by the kings.<a id="noteref_20"

          "#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          itself the view is not improbable, and it is borne out by the
          example of Sparta, the only purely Greek state which retained the
          kingly form of government in historical times. For in Sparta all
          state sacrifices were offered by the kings as descendants of the
          god.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href=

          combination of priestly functions with royal authority is familiar

          wielded at once temporal and spiritual authority, like the popes of
          mediaeval Rome. Such priest-ridden cities were Zela and

          Teutonic kings, again, in the old heathen days seem to have stood

          needless, however, to multiply examples of what is the rule rather
          than the exception in the early history of the kingship.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when we have
          said that the ancient kings were commonly priests also, we are far
          from having exhausted the religious aspect of their office. In
          those days the divinity that hedges a king was no empty form of
          speech but the expression of a sober belief. Kings were revered, in
          many cases not merely as priests, that is, as intercessors between
          man and god, but as themselves gods, able to bestow upon their
          subjects and worshippers those blessings which are commonly
          supposed to be beyond the reach of man, and are sought, if at all,
          only by prayer and sacrifice offered to superhuman and invisible
          beings. Thus kings are often expected to give rain and sunshine in
          due season, to make the crops grow, and so on. Strange as this
          expectation appears to us, it is quite of a piece with early modes
          of thought. A savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly
          drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the
          supernatural. To him the world is mostly worked by supernatural
          agents, that is, by personal beings <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> acting on impulses and motives like his own,
          liable like him to be moved by appeals to their pity, their fears,
          and their hopes. In a world so conceived he sees no limit to his
          power of influencing the course of nature to his own advantage.
          Prayers, promises, or threats may secure him fine weather and an
          abundant crop from the gods; and if a god should happen, as he
          sometimes believes, to become incarnate in his own person, then he
          need appeal to no higher power; he, the savage, possesses in
          himself all the supernatural powers necessary to further his own
          well-being and that of his fellow men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is one way
          in which the idea of a man-god is reached. But there is another.
          Side by side with the view of the world as pervaded by spiritual
          forces, primitive man has another conception in which we may detect
          a germ of the modern notion of natural law or the view of nature as
          a series of events occurring in an invariable order without the
          intervention of personal agency. The germ of which I speak is
          involved in that sympathetic magic, as it may be called, which
          plays a large part in most systems of superstition. One of the
          principles of sympathetic magic is that any effect may be produced
          by imitating it. To take a few instances. If it is wished to kill a
          person an image of him is made and then destroyed; and it is
          believed that through a certain physical sympathy between the
          person and his image, the man feels the injuries done to the image
          as if they were done to his own body, and that when it is destroyed
          he must simultaneously perish. Again, in Morocco a fowl or a pigeon
          may sometimes be seen with a little red bundle tied to its foot.
          The bundle contains a charm, and it is believed that as the charm
          is kept in constant motion by the bird a corresponding <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> restlessness is kept up in the mind of
          him or her against whom the charm is directed.<a id="noteref_26"

          Nias when a wild pig has fallen into the pit prepared for it, it is
          taken out and its back is rubbed with nine fallen leaves, in the

          just as the nine leaves fell from the tree.<a id="noteref_27" name=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Hillo! what's this? I'm afraid I'm
          caught.”</span> After that the net is sure to catch game.<a id=

          believed that this will cause the flax crop to wave in the
          wind.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> Again,
          magic sympathy is supposed to exist between a man and any severed
          portion of his person, as his hair or nails; so that whoever gets
          possession of hair or nails may work his will, at any distance,
          upon the person from whom they were cut. This superstition is
          world-wide. Further, the sympathy in question exists between
          friends and relations, especially at critical times. Hence, for
          example, the elaborate code of rules which <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> regulates the conduct of persons left at home
          while a party of their friends is out fishing or hunting or on the
          war-path. It is thought that if the persons left at home broke
          these rules their absent friends would suffer an injury,
          corresponding in its nature to the breach of the rule. Thus when a
          Dyak is out head-hunting, his wife or, if he is unmarried, his
          sister, must wear a sword day and night in order that he may always
          be thinking of his weapons; and she may not sleep during the day
          nor go to bed before two in the morning, lest her husband or
          brother should thereby be surprised in his sleep by an enemy.<a id=
          "noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> In
          Laos when an elephant hunter is setting out for the chase he warns
          his wife not to cut her hair or oil her body in his absence; for if
          she cut her hair the elephant would burst the toils, if she oiled
          herself it would slip through them.<a id="noteref_32" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these
          cases (and similar instances might be multiplied indefinitely) an
          action is performed or avoided, because its performance is believed
          to entail good or bad consequences of a sort resembling the act
          itself. Sometimes the magic sympathy takes effect not so much
          through an act as through a supposed resemblance of qualities. Thus
          some Bechuanas wear a ferret as a charm because, being very
          tenacious of life, it will make them difficult to kill.<a id=

          012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          which the hair has been taken has no horns and is therefore hard to
          catch; so the warrior who is provided with these charms believes
          that he will be as hard to hold as the ox and the frog.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we see that
          in sympathetic magic one event is supposed to be followed
          necessarily and invariably by another, without the intervention of
          any spiritual or personal agency. This is, in fact, the modern
          conception of physical causation; the conception, indeed, is
          misapplied, but it is there none the less. Here, then, we have
          another mode in which primitive man seeks to bend nature to his
          wishes. There is, perhaps, hardly a savage who does not fancy
          himself possessed of this power of influencing the course of nature
          by sympathetic magic; a man-god, on this view, is only an
          individual who is believed to enjoy this common power in an
          unusually high degree. Thus, whereas a man-god of the former or
          inspired type derives his divinity from a deity who has taken up
          his abode in a tabernacle of flesh, a man-god of the latter type
          draws his supernatural power from a certain physical sympathy with
          nature. He is not merely the receptacle of a divine spirit. His
          whole being, body and soul, is so delicately attuned to the harmony
          of the world that a touch of his hand or a turn of his head may
          send a thrill vibrating through the universal framework of things;
          and conversely his divine organism is acutely sensitive to such
          slight changes of environment as would leave ordinary mortals
          wholly unaffected. But the line between these two types of man-god,
          however sharply we may draw it in theory, is seldom to be traced
          with precision in practice, and in what follows I shall not insist
          on it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To readers long

          illustrate it by examples. When we have seen that in early society
          men who make no pretence at all of being gods do nevertheless
          commonly believe themselves to be invested with supernatural
          powers, we shall have the less difficulty in comprehending the
          extraordinary range of powers ascribed to individuals who are
          actually regarded as divine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all natural
          phenomena there are perhaps none which civilised man feels himself
          more powerless to influence than the rain, the sun, and the wind.
          Yet all these are commonly supposed by savages to be in some degree
          under their control.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To begin with
          rain-making. In a village near Dorpat in Russia, when rain was much
          wanted, three men used to climb up the fir-trees of an old sacred
          grove. One of them drummed with a hammer on a kettle or small cask
          to imitate thunder; the second knocked two fire-brands together and
          made the sparks fly, to imitate lightning; and the third, who was
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“the rain-maker,”</span> had a bunch
          of twigs with which he sprinkled water from a vessel on all
          sides.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href=
          "#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> This
          is an example of sympathetic magic; the desired event is supposed
          to be produced by imitating it. Rain is often thus made by
          imitation. In Halmahera (Gilolo), a large island to the west of New
          Guinea, a wizard makes rain by dipping a branch of a particular
          kind of tree in water and sprinkling the ground with it.<a id=

          the rain-maker wraps some leaves of a red and green striped creeper
          in a banana-leaf, moistens the bundle with water and buries it in
          the ground; then he imitates with his mouth the plashing of
          rain.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=

          Amongst the Omaha Indians of North America, when the corn is
          withering for want of rain, the members of the sacred Buffalo
          Society fill a large vessel with water and dance four times round
          it. One of them drinks some of the water and spirts it into the
          air, making a fine spray in imitation of a mist or drizzling rain.
          Then he upsets the vessel, spilling the water on the ground;
          whereupon the dancers fall down and drink up the water, getting mud
          all over their faces. Lastly they spirt the water into the air,
          making a fine mist. This saves the corn.<a id="noteref_40" name=

          Amongst the Australian Wotjobaluk the rain-maker dipped a bunch of
          his own hair in water, sucked out the water and squirted it
          westward, or he twirled the ball round his head making a spray like
          rain.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=

          Squirting water from the mouth is also a West African way of making

          Another mode is to dip a particular stone in water or sprinkle
          water on it. In a Samoan village a certain stone was carefully
          housed as the representative of the rain-making god; and in time of
          drought his priests carried the stone in procession, and dipped it
          in a stream.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href=

          Ta-ta-thi tribe of New South Wales the rain-maker breaks off a
          piece of quartz crystal and spits it towards the sky; the rest of
          the crystal he wraps in emu feathers, soaks both crystal and
          feathers in water, and carefully hides them.<a id="noteref_44"

          Fountain of Baranton, of romantic fame, in the forest of Brécilien,
          used to be resorted to by peasants when they needed rain; they
          caught some of the water in a tankard and threw it on a slab near
          the spring.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href=

          some of the Apache Indians wish for rain, they take water from a

          <span class="tei tei-q">“in a dismal dingle surrounded by high and

          lake; and if any one steps on the stones and throws water so as to
          wet the farthest stone, which is called the Red Altar, <span class=

          these cases it is probable that, as in Samoa, the stone is regarded
          as in some sort divine. This appears from the custom sometimes
          observed of dipping the cross in the Fountain of Baranton, to
          procure rain; for this is plainly a substitute for the older way of
          throwing the water on the stone.<a id="noteref_49" name=

          the water is used as a threat; but originally it was probably a
          sympathetic charm, as in the following instance. In New Caledonia
          the rain-makers blackened themselves all over, dug up a dead body,
          took the bones to a cave, jointed them, and hung the skeleton over
          some taro leaves. Water was poured over the skeleton to run down on
          the leaves. <span class="tei tei-q">“They supposed that the soul of
          the departed took up the water, made rain of it, and showered it
          down again.”</span><a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=

          same motive comes clearly out in a mode of making rain which is
          practised by various peoples of South Eastern Europe. In time of
          drought the Servians strip a girl, clothe her from head to foot in
          grass, herbs, and flowers, even her face being hidden with them.
          Thus disguised she is called the Dodola, and goes through the
          village with a troop of girls. They stop before every house; the
          Dodola dances, while the other girls form a ring round her singing
          one of the Dodola songs, and the housewife pours a pail of water
          over her.</p>

          a brook, where they set it afloat. Next they sit on the harrow and
          keep a tiny flame burning on each corner of it for an hour. Then

          province of Siam, goes in great state to a certain pagoda and prays
          to Buddha for rain. Then accompanied by his suite and followed by
          an enormous crowd he adjourns to a plain behind the pagoda. Here a
          dummy figure has been made up, dressed in bright colours, and
          placed in the middle of the plain. A wild music begins to play;
          maddened by the din of drums and cymbals and crackers, and goaded
          on by their drivers, the elephants charge down on the dummy and
          trample it to pieces. After this, Buddha will soon give rain.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another way of
          constraining the rain-god is to disturb him in his haunts. This
          seems the reason why rain is supposed to be the consequence of
          troubling a sacred spring. The Dards believe that if a cowskin or
          anything impure is placed in certain springs, storms will
          follow.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href=

          Gervasius mentions a spring into which if a stone or a stick were
          thrown, rain would at once issue from it and drench the
          thrower.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href=

          Sometimes an appeal is made to the pity of the gods. When their
          corn is being burnt up by the sun, the Zulus look out for a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“heaven-bird,”</span> kill it, and throw it
          into a pool. Then the heaven melts with tenderness for the death of
          the bird; <span class="tei tei-q">“it wails for it by raining,
          wailing a funeral wail.”</span><a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73"

          peculiar mode of making rain was adopted by the heathen Arabs. They
          tied two sorts of bushes to the tails and hind-legs of their
          cattle, and setting fire to the bushes drove the cattle to the top
          of a mountain, praying for rain.<a id="noteref_75" name=

          imitation of lightning on the horizon. But it may also be a way of
          threatening the sky; as some West African rain-makers put a pot of
          inflammable materials on the fire and blow up the flames,
          threatening that if heaven does not soon give rain they will send
          up a flame which will set the sky on fire.<a id="noteref_77" name=

          Dieyerie of South Australia have a way of their own of making rain.
          A hole is dug about twelve feet long and eight or ten broad, and
          over this hole a hut of logs and branches is made. Two men,
          supposed to have received a special inspiration from Mooramoora
          (the Good Spirit), are bled by an old and influential man with a
          sharp flint inside the arm; the blood is made to flow on the other
          men of the tribe who sit huddled together. At the same time the two
          bleeding men throw handfuls of down, some of which adheres to the
          blood, while the rest floats in the air. The blood is thought to
          represent the rain, and the down the clouds. During the ceremony
          two large stones are placed in the middle of the hut; they stand
          for gathering clouds and presage rain. Then the men who were bled
          carry away the stones for about fifteen miles and place them as
          high as they can in the tallest tree. Meanwhile, the other men
          gather gypsum, pound <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg
          021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          it fine, and throw it into a water-hole. This the Mooramoora is
          supposed to see, and at once he causes the clouds to appear in the
          sky. Lastly, the men surround the hut, butt at it with their heads,
          force their way in, and reappear on the other side, repeating this
          till the hut is wrecked. In doing this they are forbidden to use
          their hands or arms; but when the heavy logs alone remain, they are
          allowed to pull them out with their hands. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The piercing of the hut with their heads symbolises
          the piercing of the clouds; the fall of the hut, the fall of
          rain.”</span><a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href=

          proved ineffectual. For example, in Arcadia, when the corn and
          trees were parched with drought, the priest of Zeus dipped an oak
          branch into a certain spring on Mount Lycaeus. Thus troubled, the
          water sent up a misty cloud, from which rain soon fell upon the
          land.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=

          similar mode of making rain is still practised, as we have seen, in
          Halmahera near New Guinea. The people of Crannon in Thessaly had a
          bronze chariot which they kept in a temple. When they desired a
          shower they shook the chariot and the shower fell.<a id=

          Probably the rattling of the chariot was meant to imitate thunder;
          we have already seen that in Russia mock thunder and lightning form
          part of a rain-charm. The mythical Salmoneus of Thessaly made mock
          thunder by dragging bronze kettles behind his chariot or by driving
          over a bronze bridge, while <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Conversely during an eclipse of the moon some Indian tribes of the

          an ancestor. He then climbs a high mountain whose top catches the
          first rays of the morning sun. Here he deposits three sorts of
          plants on a flat stone, places a branch of dry coral beside them,
          and hangs the bundle of charms over the stone. Next morning he
          returns to this rude altar, and at the moment when the sun rises
          from the sea he kindles a fire on the altar. As the smoke rises, he
          rubs the stone with the dry coral, invokes his ancestors and says:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun! I do this that you may be burning

          the sun rises behind clouds—a rare event in the bright sky of
          Southern Africa—the Sun clan of the Bechuanas say that he is
          grieving their heart. All work stands still, and all the food of
          the previous day is given to matrons or old women. They may eat it
          and may share it with the children they are nursing, but no one
          else may taste it. The people go down to the river and wash
          themselves all over. Each man throws into the river a stone taken
          from his domestic hearth, and replaces it with one picked up in the
          bed of the river. On their return to the village the chief kindles
          a fire in his hut, and all his subjects come and get a light from
          it. A general dance follows.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90"

          of the sun. The Melanesians make sunshine by means of a mock sun. A
          round stone is wound about with red braid and stuck with owl's
          feathers to represent rays; it is then hung on a high tree. Or the
          stone is laid on the ground with white rods radiating from it to

          Sometimes the mode of making sunshine is the converse of that of
          making rain. Thus we have seen that a white or red pig is

          by another Australian custom. In their journeys the natives are
          accustomed to place stones in trees at different heights from the
          ground in order to indicate the height of the sun in the sky at the
          moment when they passed the particular tree. Those who follow are

          Possibly the natives, thus accustomed to mark the sun's progress,
          may have slipped into the confusion of imagining that to mark the
          sun's progress was to arrest it at the point marked. On the other

          in which he wishes the wind to blow. He then throws the raven

          posture at the foot of a spruce-tree, facing towards the required

          fire and in a coaxing voice invited the demon of the wind to come
          under the fire and warm himself. When he was supposed to have
          arrived, a vessel of water, to which each man present had
          contributed, was thrown on the fire by an old man, and immediately
          a flight of arrows sped towards the spot where the fire had been.
          They thought that the demon would not stay where he had been so
          badly treated. To complete the effect, guns were discharged in
          various directions, and the captain of a European vessel was asked
          to fire on the wind with cannon.<a id="noteref_117" name=

          rush from their houses armed with sword and lance. The Raja placed

          of the Psylli, the modern Tripoli, the wind blowing from the Sahara
          had dried up all the water-tanks. So the people took counsel and

          Africa that <span class="tei tei-q">“no whirlwind ever sweeps
          across the path without being pursued by a dozen savages with drawn
          creeses, who stab into the centre of the dusty column in order to

          Australia the huge columns of red sand that move rapidly across a
          desert tract are thought by the blackfellows to be spirits passing
          along. Once an athletic young black ran after one of these moving
          columns to kill it with boomerangs. He was away two or three hours
          and came back very weary, saying he had killed Koochee (the demon),
          but that Koochee <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These examples,
          drawn from the beliefs and practices of rude peoples all over the
          world, may suffice to prove that the savage, whether European or
          otherwise, fails to recognise those limitations to his power over
          nature which seem so obvious to us. In a society where every man is
          supposed to be endowed more or less with powers which we should
          call supernatural, it is plain that the distinction between gods
          and men is somewhat blurred, or rather has scarcely emerged. The
          conception of gods as supernatural beings entirely distinct from
          and superior to man, and wielding powers to which he possesses
          nothing comparable in degree and hardly even in kind, has been
          slowly evolved in the course of history. At first the supernatural
          agents are not regarded as greatly, if <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> at all, superior to man; for they may be
          frightened and coerced by him into doing his will. At this stage of
          thought the world is viewed as a great democracy; all beings in it,
          whether natural or supernatural, are supposed to stand on a footing
          of tolerable equality. But with the growth of his knowledge man
          learns to realise more clearly the vastness of nature and his own
          littleness and feebleness in presence of it. The recognition of his
          own helplessness does not, however, carry with it a corresponding
          belief in the impotence of those supernatural beings with which his
          imagination peoples the universe. On the contrary it enhances his
          conception of their power. For the idea of the world as a system of
          impersonal forces acting in accordance with fixed and invariable
          laws has not yet fully dawned or darkened upon him. The germ of the
          idea he certainly has, and he acts upon it, not only in magic art,
          but in much of the business of daily life. But the idea remains
          undeveloped, and so far as he attempts consciously to explain the
          world he lives in, he pictures it as the manifestation of conscious
          will and personal agency. If then he feels himself to be so frail
          and slight, how vast and powerful must he deem the beings who
          control the gigantic machinery of nature! Thus as his old sense of
          equality with the gods slowly vanishes, he resigns at the same time
          the hope of directing the course of nature by his own unaided
          resources, that is, by magic, and looks more and more to the gods
          as the sole repositories of those supernatural powers which he once
          claimed to share with them. With the first advance of knowledge,
          therefore, prayer and sacrifice assume the leading place in
          religious ritual; and magic, which once ranked with them as a
          legitimate equal, is gradually relegated to the background
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name=
          "Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and sinks to the
          level of a black art. It is now regarded as an encroachment, at
          once vain and impious, on the domain of the gods, and as such
          encounters the steady opposition of the priests, whose reputation
          and influence gain or lose with those of their gods. Hence, when at
          a late period the distinction between religion and superstition has
          emerged, we find that sacrifice and prayer are the resource of the
          pious and enlightened portion of the community, while magic is the
          refuge of the superstitious and ignorant. But when, still later,
          the conception of the elemental forces as personal agents is giving
          way to the recognition of natural law; then magic, based as it
          implicitly is on the idea of a necessary and invariable sequence of
          cause and effect, independent of personal will, reappears from the
          obscurity and discredit into which it had fallen, and by
          investigating the causal sequences in nature, directly prepares the
          way for science. Alchemy leads up to chemistry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The notion of a
          man-god or of a human being endowed with divine or supernatural
          powers, belongs essentially to that earlier period of religious
          history in which gods and men are still viewed as beings of much
          the same order, and before they are divided by the impassable gulf
          which, to later thought, opens out between them. Strange,
          therefore, as may seem to us the idea of a god incarnate in human
          form, it has nothing very startling for early man, who sees in a
          man-god or a god-man only a higher degree of the same supernatural
          powers which he arrogates in perfect good faith to himself. Such
          incarnate gods are common in rude society. The incarnation may be
          temporary or permanent. In the former case, the
          incarnation—commonly known as inspiration or possession—reveals
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name=
          "Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> itself in
          supernatural knowledge rather than in supernatural power. In other
          words, its usual manifestations are divination and prophesy rather
          than miracles. On the other hand, when the incarnation is not
          merely temporary, when the divine spirit has permanently taken up
          its abode in a human body, the god-man is usually expected to
          vindicate his character by working miracles. Only we have to
          remember that by men at this stage of thought miracles are not
          considered as breaches of natural law. Not conceiving the existence
          of natural law, primitive man cannot conceive a breach of it. A
          miracle is to him merely an unusually striking manifestation of a
          common power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The belief in
          temporary incarnation or inspiration is world-wide. Certain persons
          are supposed to be possessed from time to time by a spirit or
          deity; while the possession lasts, their own personality lies in
          abeyance, the presence of the spirit is revealed by convulsive
          shiverings and shakings of the man's whole body, by wild gestures
          and excited looks, all of which are referred, not to the man
          himself, but to the spirit which has entered into him; and in this
          abnormal state all his utterances are accepted as the voice of the
          god or spirit dwelling in him and speaking through him. In Mangaia
          the priests in whom the gods took up their abode from time to time
          were called <span class="tei tei-q">“god-boxes”</span> or, for
          shortness, <span class="tei tei-q">“gods.”</span> Before giving
          oracles as gods, they drank an intoxicating liquor, and in the
          frenzy thus produced their wild words were received as the voice of
          the god.<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href=

          examples of such temporary inspiration are so common in every part
          of the world <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg

          may be well, however, to refer to two particular modes of producing
          temporary inspiration, because they are perhaps less known than
          some others, and because we shall have occasion to refer to them
          later on. One of these modes of producing inspiration is by sucking
          the fresh blood of a sacrificed victim. In the temple of Apollo
          Diradiotes at Argos, a lamb was sacrificed by night once a month; a
          woman, who had to observe a rule of chastity, tasted the blood of
          the lamb, and thus being inspired by the god she prophesied or
          divined.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href=

          Aegira in Achaea the priestess of Earth drank the fresh blood of a

          blood of the sacrifice, putting the throat of the decapitated goat
          to his mouth. Then, as if he had acquired new life, he begins to
          brandish his staff of bells, and to dance with a quick but wild
          unsteady step. Suddenly the afflatus descends. There is no
          mistaking that glare, or those frantic leaps. He snorts, he stares,
          he gyrates. The demon has now taken bodily possession of him; and,
          though he retains the power of utterance and of motion, both are
          under the demon's control, and his separate consciousness is in
          abeyance.... The devil-dancer is now worshipped as a present deity,
          and every bystander consults him respecting his disease, his wants,
          the welfare of his absent relatives, the offerings to be made for
          the accomplishment of his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg

          it by force and set on a chair, whereupon he begins to prophesy how
          the rice crop will turn out that year. A second time he runs at the
          carcass and drinks of the blood; a second time he is forced into
          the chair and continues his predictions. It is thought there is a
          spirit in him which possesses the power of prophecy.<a id=

          true test of a Dainyal or diviner among some of the Hindoo Koosh

          other mode of producing temporary inspiration, to which I shall
          here refer, is by means of a branch or leaves of a sacred tree.
          Thus in the Hindoo Koosh a fire is kindled with twigs of the sacred
          cedar; and the Dainyal or sibyl, with a cloth over her head,
          inhales the thick pungent smoke till she is seized with convulsions
          and falls senseless to the ground. Soon she rises and raises a
          shrill chant, which is caught up <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class=

          worth observing that many peoples expect the victim as well as the
          priest or prophet to give signs of inspiration by convulsive
          movements of the body; and if the animal remains obstinately
          steady, they esteem it unfit for sacrifice. Thus when the Yakuts
          sacrifice to an evil spirit, the beast must bellow and roll about,
          which is considered a token that the evil spirit has entered into
          it.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href=

          Apollo's prophetess could give no oracles unless the victim to be
          sacrificed trembled in every limb when the wine was poured on its
          head. But for ordinary Greek sacrifices it was enough that the
          victim should shake its head; to make it do so, water was poured on
          it.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=

          other peoples (Tonquinese, Hindoos, Chuwash, etc.) have adopted the
          same test of a suitable victim; they pour water or wine on its
          head; if the animal shakes its head it is accepted for sacrifice;
          if it does not, it is rejected.<a id="noteref_140" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The person
          temporarily inspired is believed to acquire, not merely divine
          knowledge, but also, at least occasionally, divine power. In
          Cambodia, when an epidemic breaks out, the inhabitants of several
          villages unite and go with a band of music at their head to look
          for the man whom the local god is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          incarnation. When found, the man is taken to the altar of the god,
          where the mystery of incarnation takes place. Then the man becomes
          an object of veneration to his fellows, who implore him to protect
          the village against the plague.<a id="noteref_141" name=

          the narrowest defiles.<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far we have
          seen that the savage, failing to discern the limits of his ability
          to control nature, ascribes to himself and to all men certain
          powers which we should now call supernatural. Further, we have seen
          that over and above this general supernaturalism, some persons are
          supposed to be inspired for short periods by a divine spirit, and
          thus temporarily to enjoy the knowledge and power of the indwelling
          deity. From beliefs like these it is an easy step to the conviction
          that certain men are permanently possessed by a deity, or in some
          other undefined way are endued with so high a degree of
          supernatural powers as to be ranked as gods and to receive the
          homage of prayer and sacrifice. Sometimes these human gods are
          restricted to purely supernatural or spiritual functions. Sometimes
          they exercise supreme political power in addition. In the latter
          case they are kings as well as gods, and the government is a
          theocracy. I shall give examples of both.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Marquesas
          Islands there was a class of men who were deified in their
          life-time. They were supposed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to wield a supernatural power over the
          elements; they could give abundant harvests or smite the ground
          with barrenness; and they could inflict disease or death. Human
          sacrifices were offered to them to avert their wrath. There were
          not many of them, at the most one or two in each island. They lived
          in mystic seclusion. Their powers were sometimes, but not always,
          hereditary. A missionary has described one of these human gods from
          personal observation. The god was a very old man who lived in a
          large house within an enclosure. In the house was a kind of altar,
          and on the beams of the house and on the trees round it were hung
          human skeletons, head down. No one entered the enclosure, except
          the persons dedicated to the service of the god; only on days when
          human victims were sacrificed might ordinary people penetrate into
          the precinct. This human god received more sacrifices than all the
          other gods; often he would sit on a sort of scaffold in front of
          his house and call for two or three human victims at a time. They
          were always brought, for the terror he inspired was extreme. He was
          invoked all over the island, and offerings were sent to him from
          every side.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href=

          Again, of the South Sea Islands in general we are told that each
          island had a man who represented or personified the divinity. Such
          men were called gods, and their substance was confounded with that
          of the deity. The man-god was sometimes the king himself; oftener
          he was a priest or subordinate chief.<a id="noteref_144" name=

          Tanatoa, King of Raiatea, was deified by a certain ceremony

          the Pelew Islands it is believed that every god can take possession

          called a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          strange way; he gapes, runs about, and performs a number of
          senseless acts. At first people laugh at him, but his sacred
          mission is in time recognised, and he is invited to assume his
          proper position in the state. Generally this position is a
          distinguished one and confers on him a powerful influence over the
          whole community. In some of the islands the god is political
          sovereign of the land; and hence his new incarnation, however
          humble his origin, is raised to the same high rank, and rules, as
          god and king, over all the other chiefs.<a id="noteref_150" name=

          time of public calamity, as during war or pestilence, some of the
          Molucca Islanders used to celebrate a festival of heaven. If no
          good result followed, they bought a slave, took him at the next
          festival to the place of sacrifice, and set him on a raised place
          under a certain bamboo-tree. This tree represented heaven and had
          been honoured as its image at previous festivals. The portion of
          the sacrifice which had previously been offered to heaven was now
          given to the slave, who ate and drank it in the name and stead of
          heaven. Henceforth the slave was well treated, kept for the
          festivals of heaven, and employed to represent heaven and receive
          the offerings in its name.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151"

          powers run the risk of being worshipped as gods. Thus, a sect in

          Nikkal Sen was no other than the redoubted General Nicholson, and
          nothing that the general could do or say damped the enthusiasm of

          Amongst the Todas, a pastoral people of the Neilgherry Hills of
          Southern India, the dairy is a sanctuary, and the milkman
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pâlâl</span></span>) who attends to it is a
          god. On being asked whether the Todas salute the sun, one of these
          divine milkmen replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Those poor fellows
          do so, but I,”</span> tapping his chest, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I, a god! why should I salute the sun?”</span> Every
          one, even his own father, prostrates himself before the milkman,
          and no one would dare to refuse him anything. No human being,
          except another milkman, may touch him; and he gives oracles to all
          who consult him, speaking with the voice of a god.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes, at
          the death of the human incarnation, the divine spirit transmigrates
          into another man. In the kingdom of Kaffa, in Eastern Africa, the
          heathen part of the people worship a spirit called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Deòce</span></span>, to whom they offer prayer
          and sacrifice, and whom they invoke on all important occasions.
          This spirit is incarnate in the grand magician or pope, a person of
          great wealth and influence, ranking almost with the king, and
          wielding the spiritual, as the king wields the temporal, power. It
          happened that, shortly before the arrival of a Christian missionary
          in the kingdom, this African pope died, and the priests, fearing
          that the missionary would assume the position vacated by the
          deceased pope, declared that the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Deòce</span></span> had passed into the king,
          who henceforth, uniting the spiritual with the temporal power,

          Before beginning to work at the salt-pans in a Laosian village, the
          workmen offer sacrifice to a local divinity. This divinity is
          incarnate in a woman and transmigrates at her death into another

          Bhotan the spiritual head of the government is a person called the
          Dhurma Raja, who is supposed to be a perpetual incarnation of the
          deity. At his death the new incarnate god shows himself in an
          infant by the refusal of his mother's milk and a preference for
          that of a cow.<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href=

          Buddhist Tartars believe in a great number of living Buddhas, who
          officiate as Grand Lamas at the head of the most <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> important monasteries. When one of
          these Grand Lamas dies his disciples do not sorrow, for they know
          that he will soon reappear, being born in the form of an infant.
          Their only anxiety is to discover the place of his birth. If at
          this time they see a rainbow they take it as a sign sent them by
          the departed Lama to guide them to his cradle. Sometimes the divine
          infant himself reveals his identity. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
          the Grand Lama,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          living Buddha of such and such a temple. Take me to my old
          monastery. I am its immortal head.”</span> In whatever way the
          birthplace of the Buddha is revealed, whether by the Buddha's own
          avowal or by the sign in the sky, tents are struck, and the joyful
          pilgrims, often headed by the king or one of the most illustrious
          of the royal family, set forth to find and bring home the infant
          god. Generally he is born in Tibet, the holy land, and to reach him
          the caravan has often to traverse the most frightful deserts. When
          at last they find the child they fall down and worship him. Before,
          however, he is acknowledged as the Grand Lama whom they seek he
          must satisfy them of his identity. He is asked the name of the
          monastery of which he claims to be the head, how far off it is, and
          how many monks live in it; he must also describe the habits of the
          deceased Grand Lama and the manner of his death. Then various
          articles, as prayer-books, tea-pots, and cups, are placed before
          him, and he has to point out those used by himself in his previous
          life. If he does so without a mistake his claims are admitted, and
          he is conducted in triumph to the monastery.<a id="noteref_161"

          the head of all the Lamas is the Dalai Lama of Lhasa, the Rome of

          is born again in a child. According to some accounts the mode of
          discovering the Dalai Lama is similar to the method, already
          described, of discovering an ordinary Grand Lama. Other accounts
          speak of an election by lot. Wherever he is born, the trees and
          plants, it is said, put forth green leaves; at his bidding flowers
          bloom and springs of water rise; and his presence diffuses heavenly
          blessings. His palace stands on a commanding height; its gilded
          cupolas are seen sparkling in the sunlight for miles.<a id=

          Spanish conquerors were astonished to find, in contrast to the
          savage hordes they had left in the sweltering jungles below, a
          people enjoying a fair degree of civilisation, practising
          agriculture, and living under a government which Humboldt has
          compared to the theocracies of Tibet and Japan. These were the
          Chibchas, Muyscas, or Mozcas, divided into two kingdoms, with
          capitals at Bogota and Tunja, but united apparently in spiritual
          allegiance to the high pontiff of Sogamozo or Iraca. By a long and
          ascetic novitiate, this ghostly ruler was reputed to have acquired
          such sanctity that the waters and the rain obeyed him, and the

          woman. The incarnate god is much feared by all the people,
          including the king and the chiefs. He is consulted as an oracle; by
          his word he can inflict or heal sickness, withhold rain, and cause
          famine. Large presents are made him when his advice is
          sought.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href=

          the king, standing on his throne, shoots an arrow into the air,

          obtain with more facility what they need. Thus, prostrate at his

          peoples have gone further and killed their kings in times of
          scarcity. Thus, in the time of the Swedish king Domalde a mighty
          famine broke out, which lasted several years, and could be stayed
          by the blood neither of beasts nor of men. So, in a great popular
          assembly held at Upsala, the chiefs decided that king Domalde
          himself was the cause of the scarcity and must be sacrificed for
          good seasons. So they slew him and smeared with his blood the
          altars of the gods. Again, we are told that the Swedes always
          attributed good or bad crops to their kings as the cause. Now, in
          the reign of King Olaf, there came dear times and famine, and the
          people thought that the fault was the king's, because he was
          sparing in his sacrifices. So, mustering an army, they marched
          against him, surrounded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg

          the coral island of Niuē, or Savage Island, in the South Pacific,
          there formerly reigned a line of kings. But as the kings were also
          high priests, and were supposed to make the food grow, the people
          became angry with them in times of scarcity and killed them; till
          at last, as one after another was killed, no one would be king, and

          beasts, were responsible for the course of nature. When pestilence
          and other calamities had fallen on the land, in consequence of a
          long and severe drought, the priests took the sacred animals
          secretly by night, and threatened them, but if the evil did not

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this survey
          of the religious position occupied by the king in rude societies we
          may infer that the claim to divine and supernatural powers put
          forward by the monarchs of great historical empires like those of
          Egypt, Mexico, and Peru, was not the simple outcome of inflated
          vanity or the empty expression of a grovelling adulation; it was
          merely a survival and extension of the old savage apotheosis of
          living kings. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg

          Thus, for example, as children of the Sun the Incas of Peru were
          revered like gods; they could do no wrong, and no one dreamed of
          offending against the person, honour, or property of the monarch or
          of any of the royal race. Hence, too, the Incas did not, like most
          people, look on sickness as an evil. They considered it a messenger
          sent from their father the Sun to call his son to come and rest
          with him in heaven. Therefore the usual words in which an Inca

          kings sometimes cast that of the gods into the shade. Thus in the
          reign of Merenra a high official declared that he had built many
          holy places in order that the spirits of the king, the ever-living
          Merenra, might be invoked <span class="tei tei-q">“more than all

          harvest, maker and fashioner of mortals, bestower of breath upon
          all men, giver of life to all the host of gods, pillar of heaven,

          as we should expect, the exalted powers thus ascribed to the king
          differed in degree rather than in kind from those which every

          one in danger or need could by the use of magic sentences assume
          the form of a deity, it is quite comprehensible how the king, not
          only after death, but already during his life, was placed on a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it appears
          that the same union of sacred <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> functions with a royal title which meets us
          in the King of the Wood at Nemi, the Sacrificial King at Rome and
          the King Archon at Athens, occurs frequently outside the limits of
          classical antiquity and is a common feature of societies at all
          stages from barbarism to civilisation. Further, it appears that the
          royal priest is often a king in fact as well as in name, swaying
          the sceptre as well as the crosier. All this confirms the tradition
          of the origin of the titular and priestly kings in the republics of
          ancient Greece and Italy. At least by showing that the combination
          of spiritual and temporal power, of which Graeco-Italian tradition
          preserved the memory, has actually existed in many places, we have
          obviated any suspicion of improbability that might have attached to
          the tradition. Therefore we may now fairly ask, May not the King of
          the Wood have had an origin like that which a probable tradition
          assigns to the Sacrificial King of Rome and the King Archon of
          Athens? In other words, may not his predecessors in office have
          been a line of kings whom a republican revolution stripped of their
          political power, leaving them only their religious functions and
          the shadow of a crown? There are at least two reasons for answering
          this question in the negative. One reason is drawn from the abode
          of the priest of Nemi; the other from his title, the King of the
          Wood. If his predecessors had been kings in the ordinary sense, he
          would surely have been found residing, like the fallen kings of
          Rome and Athens, in the city of which the sceptre had passed from
          him. This city must have been Aricia, for there was none nearer.
          But Aricia, as we have seen, was three miles off from his forest
          sanctuary by the lake shore. If he reigned, it was not in the city,
          but in the greenwood. Again <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> his title, King of the Wood, hardly allows us
          to suppose that he had ever been a king in the common sense of the
          word. More likely he was a king of nature, and of a special side of
          nature, namely, the woods from which he took his title. If we could
          find instances of what we may call departmental kings of nature,
          that is of persons supposed to rule over particular elements or
          aspects of nature, they would probably present a closer analogy to
          the King of the Wood than the divine kings we have been hitherto
          considering, whose control of nature is general rather than
          special. Instances of such departmental kings are not wanting.</p>

          some of the tribes on the Upper Nile we are told that they have no
          kings in the common sense; the only persons whom they acknowledge
          as such are the Kings of the Rain, <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Mata
          Kodou</span></span>, who are credited with the power of giving rain
          at the proper time, that is in the rainy season. Before the rains
          begin to fall at the end of March the country is a parched and arid
          desert; and the cattle, which form the people's chief wealth,
          perish for lack of grass. So, when the end of March draws on, each
          householder betakes himself to the King of the Rain and offers him
          a cow that he may make the rain to fall soon. If no shower falls,
          the people assemble and demand that the king shall give them rain;
          and if the sky still continues cloudless, they rip up his belly in
          which he is believed to keep the storms. Amongst the Bari tribe one
          of these Rain Kings made rain <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among tribes on
          the outskirts of Abyssinia a similar office exists and has been
          thus described by an observer. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          priesthood of the Alfai, as he is called by the Barea and Kunáma,
          is a remarkable one; he is believed to be able to make rain. This
          office formerly existed among the Algeds and appears to be still
          common to the Nuba negroes. The Alfai of the Bareas, who is also
          consulted by the northern Kunáma, lives near Tembádere on a
          mountain alone with his family. The people bring him tribute in the
          form of clothes and fruits, and cultivate for him a large field of
          his own. He is a kind of king, and his office passes by inheritance
          to his brother or sister's son. He is supposed to conjure down rain
          and to drive away the locusts. But if he disappoints the people's
          expectation and a great drought arises in the land, the Alfai is
          stoned to death, and his nearest relations are obliged to cast the
          first stone at him. When we passed through the country, the office
          of Alfai was still held by an old man; but I heard that rain-making
          had proved too dangerous for him and that he had renounced his
          office.”</span><a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the backwoods
          of Cambodia live two mysterious sovereigns known as the King of the
          Fire and the King of the Water. Their fame is spread all over the
          south of the great Indo-Chinese peninsula; but only a faint echo of
          it has reached the West. No European, so far as is known, has ever
          seen them; and their very existence might have passed for a fable,
          were it not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg
          054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that till a few years ago communications were regularly maintained
          between them and the King of Cambodia, who year by year exchanged
          presents with them. The Cambodian gifts were passed from tribe to
          tribe till they reached their destination; for no Cambodian would
          essay the long and perilous journey. The tribe amongst whom the
          Kings of Fire and Water reside is the Chréais or Jaray, a race with
          European features but a sallow complexion, inhabiting the
          forest-clad mountains and high plateaux which separate Cambodia
          from Annam. Their royal functions are of a purely mystic or
          spiritual order; they have no political authority; they are simple
          peasants, living by the sweat of their brow and the offerings of
          the faithful. According to one account they live in absolute
          solitude, never meeting each other and never seeing a human face.
          They inhabit successively seven towers perched upon seven
          mountains, and every year they pass from one tower to another.
          People come furtively and cast within their reach what is needful
          for their subsistence. The kingship lasts seven years, the time
          necessary to inhabit all the towers successively; but many die
          before their time is out. The offices are hereditary in one or
          (according to others) two royal families, who enjoy high
          consideration, have revenues assigned to them, and are exempt from
          the necessity of tilling the ground. But naturally the dignity is
          not coveted, and when a vacancy occurs, all eligible men (they must
          be strong and have children) flee and hide themselves. Another
          account, admitting the reluctance of the hereditary candidates to
          accept the crown, does not countenance the report of their
          hermit-like seclusion in the seven towers. For it represents the
          people <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg
          055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as prostrating themselves before the mystic kings whenever they
          appear in public, it being thought that a terrible hurricane would
          burst over the country if this mark of homage were omitted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same report
          says that the Fire King, the more important of the two, and whose
          supernatural powers have never been questioned, officiates at
          marriages, festivals, and sacrifices in honour of the Yan. On these
          occasions a special place is set apart for him; and the path by
          which he approaches is spread with white cotton cloths. A reason
          for confining the royal dignity to the same family is that this
          family is in possession of certain famous talismans which would
          lose their virtue or disappear if they passed out of the family.
          These talismans are three: the fruit of a creeper called
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cui</span></span>, gathered ages ago but still
          fresh and green; a rattan, also very old and still not dry; lastly
          a sword containing a Yan or spirit, who guards it constantly and
          works miracles with it. To this wondrous brand sacrifices of
          buffaloes, pigs, fowls, and ducks are offered for rain. It is kept
          swathed in cotton and silk; and amongst the annual presents sent by
          the King of Cambodia were rich stuffs to wrap the sacred sword.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In return the
          Kings of Fire and Water sent him a huge wax candle and two
          calabashes, one full of rice and the other of sesame. The candle
          bore the impress of the Fire King's middle finger. Probably the
          candle was thought to contain the seed of fire, which the Cambodian
          monarch thus received once a year fresh from the Fire King himself.
          The holy candle was kept for sacred uses. On reaching the capital
          of Cambodia it was entrusted to the Brahmans, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who laid it up beside the regalia, and
          with the wax made tapers which were burned on the altars on solemn
          days. As the candle was the special gift of the Fire King, we may
          conjecture that the rice and sesame were the special gift of the
          Water King. The latter was doubtless king of rain as well as of
          water, and the fruits of the earth were boons conferred by him on
          men. In times of calamity, as during plague, floods, and war, a
          little of this sacred rice and sesame was scattered on the ground
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to appease the wrath of the maleficent

          Hampshire to Devon. In the reign of Henry II the citizens of London
          still hunted the wild bull and the boar in the forest of Hampstead.
          Even under the later Plantagenets the royal forests were
          sixty-eight in number. In the forest of Arden it was said that down

          However this may be, tree-worship is well attested for all the
          great European families of the Aryan stock. Amongst the Celts the

          Sacred groves were common among the ancient Germans, and

          Amongst the ancient Prussians (a Slavonian people) the central
          feature of religion was the reverence for the sacred oaks, of which

          Nowhere, perhaps, in the ancient world was this antique form of
          religion better preserved than in the heart of the great metropolis
          itself. In the Forum, the busy centre of Roman life, the sacred
          fig-tree of Romulus was worshipped down to the days of the empire,
          and the withering of its trunk was enough to spread consternation

          one of the most sacred objects in Rome. Whenever the tree appeared
          to a passer-by to be drooping, he set up a hue and cry which was
          echoed by the people in the street, and soon a crowd might be seen
          running from all sides with buckets of water, as if (says Plutarch)

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is
          necessary to examine in some detail the notions on which
          tree-worship is based. To the savage the world in general is
          animate, and trees are no exception to the rule. He thinks that
          they have souls like his own and he treats them accordingly. Thus
          the Wanika in Eastern Africa fancy that every tree and especially
          every cocoa-nut tree has its spirit: <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          destruction of a cocoa-nut tree is regarded as equivalent to
          matricide, because that tree gives them life and nourishment, as a
          mother does her child.”</span><a id="noteref_207" name=

          Siamese monks, believing that there are souls everywhere and that
          to destroy anything whatever is forcibly to dispossess a soul, will
          not break a branch of a tree <span class="tei tei-q">“as they will
          not break the arm of an innocent person.”</span><a id="noteref_208"

          monks, of course, are Buddhists. But Buddhist animism is not a
          philosophical theory. It is simply a common savage dogma
          incorporated in the system of an historical religion. To suppose
          with Benfey and others that the theories of animism and
          transmigration current among rude peoples of Asia are derived from
          Buddhism is to reverse the facts. Buddhism in this respect borrowed
          from savagery, not savagery from Buddhism. Again, the Dyaks ascribe
          souls to trees and do not dare to cut down an old tree. In some
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name=

          of the tree-spirit, which can quit the injured tree as men quit a

          the tree-spirit; and when we read of sacred trees which may not be
          cut down because they are the seat of spirits, it is not always
          possible to say with certainty in which way the presence of the
          spirit in the tree is conceived. In the following cases, perhaps,
          the trees are conceived as the dwelling-place of the spirits rather
          than as their bodies. The old Prussians, it is said, believed that
          gods inhabited high trees, such as oaks, from which they gave
          audible answers to inquirers; hence these trees were not felled,
          but worshipped as the homes of divinities.<a id="noteref_236" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even where no
          mention is made of wood-spirits, we may generally assume that when
          a grove is sacred and inviolable, it is so because it is believed
          to be either inhabited or animated by sylvan deities. In Livonia
          there is a sacred grove in which, if any man fells a tree or breaks

          Sacrifices offered at cutting down trees are doubtless meant to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a tree
          comes to be viewed, no longer as the body of the tree-spirit, but
          simply as its dwelling-place which it can quit at pleasure, an
          important advance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg
          066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          has been made in religious thought. Animism is passing into
          polytheism. In other words, instead of regarding each tree as a
          living and conscious being, man now sees in it merely a lifeless,
          inert mass, tenanted for a longer or shorter time by a supernatural
          being who, as he can pass freely from tree to tree, thereby enjoys
          a certain right of possession or lordship over the trees, and,
          ceasing to be a tree-soul, becomes a forest god. As soon as the
          tree-spirit is thus in a measure disengaged from each particular
          tree, he begins to change his shape and assume the body of a man,
          in virtue of a general tendency of early thought to clothe all
          abstract spiritual beings in concrete human form. Hence in
          classical art the sylvan deities are depicted in human shape, their
          woodland character being denoted by a branch or some equally
          obvious symbol.<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href=
          "#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          this change of shape does not affect the essential character of the
          tree-spirit. The powers which he exercised as a tree-soul
          incorporate in a tree, he still continues to wield as a god of
          trees. This I shall now prove in detail. I shall show, first, that
          trees considered as animate beings are credited with the power of
          making the rain to fall, the sun to shine, flocks and herds to
          multiply, and women to bring forth easily; and, second, that the
          very same powers are attributed to tree-gods conceived as
          anthropomorphic beings or as actually incarnate in living men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, then,
          trees or tree-spirits are believed to give rain and sunshine. When
          the missionary Jerome of Prague was persuading the heathen
          Lithuanians to fell their sacred groves, a multitude <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of women besought the Prince of
          Lithuania to stop him, saying that with the woods he was destroying
          the house of god from which they had been wont to get rain and

          extort rain from the tree-spirit a branch is sometimes dipped in
          water, as we have seen above.<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a> In
          such cases the spirit is doubtless supposed to be immanent in the
          branch, and the water thus applied to the spirit produces rain by a
          sort of sympathetic magic, exactly as we saw that in New Caledonia
          the rain-makers pour water on a skeleton, believing that the soul
          of the deceased will convert the water into rain.<a id=

          same idea comes out in the German and French custom of the
          Harvest-May. This is a large branch or a whole tree, which is
          decked with ears of corn, brought home on the last waggon from the
          harvest-field, and fastened on the roof of the farmhouse or of the
          barn, where it remains for a year. Mannhardt has proved that this
          branch or tree embodies the tree-spirit conceived as the spirit of
          vegetation in general, whose vivifying and fructifying influence is
          thus brought to bear upon the corn in particular. Hence in Swabia
          the Harvest-May is fastened amongst the last stalks of corn left
          standing on the field; in other places it is planted on the
          cornfield and the last sheaf cut is fastened to its trunk.<a id=

          or laurel, bound about with ribbons and hung with a variety of
          fruits. This branch was carried in procession at a harvest festival
          and was fastened over the door of the house, where it remained for
          a year. The object of preserving the Harvest-May or the <span lang=
          "el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">eiresione</span></span> for a year is that the
          life-giving virtue of the bough may foster the growth of the crops
          throughout the year. By the end of the year the virtue of the bough
          is supposed to be exhausted and it is replaced by a new one.
          Following a similar train of thought some of the Dyaks of Sarawak
          are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name=
          "Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> careful at the rice
          harvest to take up the roots of a certain bulbous plant, which
          bears a beautiful crown of white and fragrant flowers. These roots
          are preserved with the rice in the granary and are planted again
          with the seed-rice in the following season; for the Dyaks say that
          the rice will not grow unless a plant of this sort be in the
          field.<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Customs like
          that of the Harvest-May appear to exist in India and Africa. At a
          harvest festival of the Lhoosai of S. E. India the chief goes with
          his people into the forest and fells a large tree, which is then
          carried into the village and set up in the midst. Sacrifice is
          offered, and spirits and rice are poured over the tree. The
          ceremony closes with a feast and a dance, at which the unmarried
          men and girls are the only performers.<a id="noteref_259" name=

          serious offence to cut a bough from it and carry it into the
          village during the rainy season. But when the corn is ripe in the
          ear the people go with axes, and each man brings home a branch of
          the sacred hack-thorn, with which they repair the village
          cattle-yard.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          fructifying power of the tree is put forth at seed-time as well as
          at harvest. Among the Aryan tribes of Gilgit, on the north-western

          the people receive from the Raja's granary a quantity of wheat,
          which is placed in a skin mixed with sprigs of the sacred cedar. A
          large bonfire of the cedar wood is lighted, and the wheat which is
          to be sown is held over the smoke. The rest is ground and made into
          a large cake, which is baked on the same fire and given to the

          the intention of fertilising the seed by means of the sacred cedar
          is unmistakable. In all these cases the power of fostering the
          growth of crops, and, in general, of cultivated plants, is ascribed
          to trees. The ascription is not unnatural. For the tree is the
          largest and most powerful member of the vegetable kingdom, and man
          is familiar with it before he takes to cultivating corn. Hence he
          naturally places the feebler and, to him, newer plant under the
          dominion of the older and more powerful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the

          supposed to possess this virtue in addition to that of fertilising
          the corn. At the commencement of wheat-sowing three chosen
          unmarried youths, after undergoing daily washing and purification
          for three days, used to start for the mountain where the cedars
          grew, taking with them wine, oil, bread, and fruit of every kind.
          Having found a suitable tree they sprinkled the wine and oil on it,
          while they ate the bread and fruit as a sacrificial feast. Then
          they cut off the branch and brought it to the village, where, amid
          general rejoicing, it was placed on a large stone beside running
          water. <span class="tei tei-q">“A goat was then sacrificed, its

          brandished about, and the head of the slaughtered goat was borne
          aloft, after which it was set up as a mark for arrows and
          bullet-practice. Every good shot was rewarded with a gourd full of
          wine and some of the flesh of the goat. When the flesh was finished
          the bones were thrown into the stream and a general ablution took
          place, after which every man went to his house taking with him a
          spray of the cedar. On arrival at his house he found the door shut
          in his face, and on his knocking for admission, his wife asked,

          for wants to be fulfilled. The next day the wife baked a number of
          cakes, and taking them with her, drove the family goats to the
          Chili stone. When they were collected round the stone, she began to
          pelt them with pebbles, invoking the Chili at the same time.
          According to the direction in which the goats ran off, omens were
          drawn as to the number and sex of the kids expected during the
          ensuing year. Walnuts and pomegranates were then placed on the
          Chili stone, the cakes were distributed and <span class=

          pasture in whatever direction they showed a disposition to go. For
          five days afterwards this song was sung in all the

          of the goats to the stone on which the cedar had been placed is
          clearly meant to impart to them the fertilising influence of the
          cedar. In Europe the May-tree (May-pole) is supposed to possess
          similar powers over both women and cattle. In some parts of Germany
          on the 1st of May the peasants set up May-trees at the doors of
          stables and byres, one May-tree for each horse and cow; this is
          thought to make the cows yield much milk.<a id="noteref_264" name=

          in the forest and has the weal of the cattle in his hands. Every

          a high tree, round which the people dance noisily. On almost every
          day of the year prayer and sacrifice are offered to him that he may
          protect the cattle. Sometimes the image of Metsik is made of a
          corn-sheaf and fastened to a tall tree in the wood. The people
          perform strange antics before it to induce Metsik to guard the corn

          pear-tree. In autumn, on the day of the festival, it is carried
          into the house with great ceremony to the sound of music and amid
          the joyous cries of all the inmates, who compliment it on its
          fortunate arrival. It is covered with candles, and a cheese is
          fastened to its top. Round about it they eat, drink, and sing. Then
          they bid it good-bye and take it back to the courtyard, where it
          remains for the rest of the year, set up against the wall, without

          guardian-tree (lime, ash, or elm) in the neighbourhood of every
          farm. No one would pluck a single leaf of the sacred tree, any
          injury to which was punished by ill-luck or sickness. Pregnant
          women used to clasp the tree in their arms in order to ensure an
          easy delivery.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this review
          of the beneficent qualities commonly ascribed to tree-spirits, it
          is easy to understand why customs like the May-tree or May-pole
          have prevailed so widely and figured so prominently in the popular
          festivals of European peasants. In spring or early summer or even
          on Midsummer Day, it was and still is in many parts of Europe the
          custom to go out to the woods, cut down a tree and bring it into
          the village, where it is set up amid general rejoicings. Or the
          people cut branches in the woods, and fasten them on every house.
          The intention of these customs is to bring home to the village, and
          to each house, the blessings which the tree-spirit has in its power
          to bestow. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg
          075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Hence the custom in some places of planting a May-tree before every
          house, or of carrying the village May-tree from door to door, that
          every household may receive its share of the blessing. Out of the
          mass of evidence on this subject a few examples may be
          selected.</p>

          family sets up before their door a green bush, strewed over with
          yellow flowers, which the meadows yield plentifully. In countries
          where timber is plentiful, they erect tall slender trees, which
          stand high, and they continue almost the whole year; so as a
          stranger would go nigh to imagine that they were all signs of
          ale-sellers, and that all houses were ale-houses.”</span><a id=

          which they dress up in woman's clothes, or adorn with many-coloured
          shreds and ribbons. After that comes a feast, at the end of which
          they take the dressed-up birch-tree, carry it home to their village
          with joyful dance and song, and set it up in one of the houses,
          where it remains as an honoured guest till Whitsunday. On the two
          intervening days they pay visits to the house where their
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘guest’</span> is; but on the third day,
          Whitsunday, they take her to a stream and fling her into its

          turned, a little before Whitsunday, into a sort of garden.
          Everywhere along the streets the young birch-trees stand in rows,

          villages of Altmark it was formerly the custom for serving-men,
          grooms, and cowherds to go from farm to farm at Whitsuntide
          distributing crowns made of birch-branches and flowers to the
          farmers; these crowns were hung up in the houses and left till the

          face blackened; in front of him is carried a large May-tree, but
          each member of the band also carries a smaller one. One of the

          house singing May songs; the purport of which is a prayer for fine
          weather, a plentiful harvest, and worldly and spiritual blessings.
          One of them carries a basket in which he collects gifts of eggs and
          the like. If they are well received they stick a leafy twig in the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in Sweden
          midsummer is the season when these ceremonies are chiefly observed.
          On the Eve of St. John (23d June) the houses are thoroughly
          cleansed and garnished with green boughs and flowers. Young
          fir-trees are raised at the door-way and elsewhere about the
          homestead; and very often small umbrageous arbours are constructed
          in the garden. In Stockholm on this day a leaf-market is held at
          which thousands of May-poles (<span lang="sv" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sv"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Maj Stănger</span></span>) six inches to
          twelve feet high, decorated with leaves, flowers, slips of coloured
          paper, gilt egg-shells, strung on reeds, etc. are exposed for sale.
          Bonfires are lit on the hills and the people dance round them and
          jump over them. But the chief event of the day is setting up the
          May-pole. This consists of a straight and tall spruce-pine tree,
          stripped of its branches. <span class="tei tei-q">“At times hoops
          and at others pieces of wood, placed crosswise, are attached to it
          at intervals; whilst at others it is provided with bows,
          representing so to say, a man with his arms akimbo. From top to
          bottom not only the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Maj Stăng’</span>
          (May-pole) itself, but the hoops, bows, etc. are ornamented with
          leaves, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg
          079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          flowers, slips of various cloth, gilt egg-shells, etc.; and on the
          top of it is a large vane, or it may be a flag.”</span> The raising
          of the May-pole, the decoration of which is done by the village
          maidens, is an affair of much ceremony; the people flock to it from
          all quarters and dance round it in a great ring.<a id="noteref_287"
          name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class=

          some parts of Bohemia also a May-pole or midsummer-tree is erected
          on St. John's Eve. The lads fetch a tall fir or pine from the wood
          and set it up on a height, where the girls deck it with nosegays,
          garlands, and red ribbons. Then they pile brushwood, dry wood, and
          other combustible materials about the tree, and, when darkness has
          fallen, set the whole on fire. While the fire was burning the lads
          used to climb up the tree and fetch down the garlands and ribbons
          which the girls had fastened to it; but as this led to accidents,
          the custom has been forbidden. Sometimes the young people fling
          burning besoms into the air, or run shouting down hill with them.
          When the tree is consumed, the young men and their sweethearts
          stand on opposite sides of the fire, and look at each other through
          garlands and through the fire, to see whether they will be true
          lovers and will wed. Then they throw the garlands thrice across the
          smouldering fire to each other. When the blaze has died down, the
          couples join hands and leap thrice across the glowing embers. The
          singed garlands are taken home, and kept carefully in the house
          throughout the year. Whenever a thunder-storm bursts, part of the
          garlands are burned on the hearth; and when the cattle are sick or
          are calving, they get a portion of the garlands to eat. The charred
          embers of the bonfire are stuck in the cornfields and meadows and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name=
          "Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on the roof of the
          house, to keep house and field from bad weather and injury.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is hardly
          necessary to illustrate the custom of setting up a village May-tree
          or May-pole on May Day. One point only—the renewal of the village
          May-tree—requires to be noticed. In England the village May-pole
          seems as a rule, at least in later times, to have been permanent,
          not renewed from year to year.<a id="noteref_289" name=
          "noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a>
          Sometimes, however, it was renewed annually. Thus, Borlase says of
          the Cornish people: <span class="tei tei-q">“From towns they make
          incursions, on May-eve, into the country, cut down a tall elm,
          bring it into the town with rejoicings, and having fitted a
          straight taper pole to the end of it, and painted it, erect it in
          the most public part, and upon holidays and festivals dress it with
          garlands of flowers or ensigns and streamers.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a> An
          annual renewal seems also to be implied in the description by
          Stubbs, a Puritanical writer, of the custom of drawing home the
          May-pole by twenty or forty yoke of oxen.<a id="noteref_291" name=
          "noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> In
          some parts of Germany and Austria the May-tree or Whitsuntide-tree
          is renewed annually, a fresh tree being felled and set up.<a id=
          "noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can hardly
          doubt that originally the practice everywhere was to set up a new
          May-tree every year. As the object of the custom was to bring in
          the fructifying spirit of vegetation, newly awakened in spring, the
          end would have been defeated if, instead of a living tree, green
          and sappy, an old withered one had been erected year after year or
          allowed to stand permanently. When, however, the meaning of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name=
          "Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> custom had been
          forgotten, and the May-tree was regarded simply as a centre for
          holiday merrymaking, people saw no reason for felling a fresh tree
          every year, and preferred to let the same tree stand permanently,
          only decking it with fresh flowers on May Day. But even when the
          May-pole had thus become a fixture, the need of giving it the
          appearance of being a green tree, not a dead pole, was sometimes
          felt. Thus at Weverham in Cheshire <span class="tei tei-q">“are two
          May-poles, which are decorated on this day (May Day) with all due
          attention to the ancient solemnity; the sides are hung with
          garlands, and the top terminated by a birch or other tall slender
          tree with its leaves on; the bark being peeled, and the stem
          spliced to the pole, so as to give the appearance of one tree from
          the summit.”</span><a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href=
          "#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a> Thus
          the renewal of the May-tree is like the renewal of the Harvest-May;
          each is intended to secure a fresh portion of the fertilising
          spirit of vegetation, and to preserve it throughout the year. But
          whereas the efficacy of the Harvest-May is restricted to promoting
          the growth of the crops, that of the May-tree or May-branch extends
          also, as we have seen, to women and cattle. Lastly, it is worth
          noting that the old May-tree is sometimes burned at the end of the
          year. Thus in the district of Prague young people break pieces off
          the public May-tree and place them behind the holy pictures in
          their rooms, where they remain till next May Day, and are then
          burned on the hearth.<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href=

          Würtemberg the bushes which are set up on the houses on Palm Sunday
          are sometimes left there for a year and then burnt.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for the
          tree-spirit conceived as incorporate or immanent in the tree. We
          have now to show that the tree-spirit is often conceived and
          represented as detached from the tree and clothed in human form,
          and even as embodied in living men or women. The evidence for this
          anthropomorphic representation of the tree-spirit is largely to be
          found in the popular customs of European peasantry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is an
          instructive class of cases in which the tree-spirit is represented
          simultaneously in vegetable form and in human form, which are set
          side by side as if for the express purpose of explaining each
          other. In these cases the human representative of the tree-spirit
          is sometimes a doll or puppet, sometimes a living person; but
          whether a puppet or a person, it is placed beside a tree or bough;
          so that together the person or puppet, and the tree or bough, form
          a sort of bilingual inscription, the one being, so to speak, a
          translation of the other. Here, therefore, there is no room left
          for doubt that the spirit of the tree is actually represented in
          human form. Thus in Bohemia, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, young
          people throw a puppet called Death into the water; then the girls
          go into the wood, cut down a young tree, and fasten to it a puppet
          dressed in white clothes to look like a woman; with this tree and
          puppet they go from house to house collecting gratuities and
          singing songs with the refrain—</p>

          Carinthia, on St. George's Day (24th April), the young people deck
          with flowers and garlands a tree which has been felled on the eve
          of the festival. The tree is then carried in procession,
          accompanied with music and joyful acclamations, the chief figure in
          the procession being the Green George, a young fellow clad from
          head to foot in green birch branches. At the close of the
          ceremonies the Green George, that is an effigy of him, is thrown
          into the water. It is the aim of the lad who acts Green George to
          step out of his leafy envelope and substitute the effigy so
          adroitly that no one shall perceive the change. In many places,
          however, the lad himself who plays the part of Green George is
          ducked in a river or pond, with the express intention of thus
          ensuring rain to make the fields and meadows green in summer. In
          some places the cattle are crowned and driven from their stalls to
          the accompaniment of a song—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the same powers of making rain and fostering the cattle, which are
          ascribed to the tree-spirit regarded as incorporate in the tree,
          are also attributed to the tree-spirit represented by a living
          man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An example of
          the double representation of the spirit of vegetation by a tree and
          a living man is reported from Bengal. The Oraons have a festival in
          spring while the sál trees are in blossom, because they think that
          at this time the marriage of earth is celebrated and the sál
          flowers are necessary for the ceremony. On an appointed day the
          villagers go with their priest to the Sarna, the sacred grove, a
          remnant of the old sál forest in which a goddess Sarna Burhi, or
          woman of the grove, is supposed to dwell. She is thought to have
          great influence on the rain; and the priest arriving with his party
          at the grove sacrifices to her five fowls, of which a morsel is
          given to each person present. Then they gather the sál flowers and
          return laden with them to the village. Next day the priest visits
          every house, carrying the flowers in a wide open basket. The women
          of each house bring out water to wash his feet as he approaches,
          and kneeling make him an obeisance. Then he dances with them and
          places some of the sál flowers over the door of the house and in
          the women's hair. No sooner is this done than the women empty their
          water-jugs over him, drenching him to the skin. A feast follows,
          and the young people, with sál flowers in their hair, dance all
          night on the village green.<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304"

          comes out plainly. For she is supposed to influence the rain, and
          the drenching of the priest with water is, doubtless, like the
          ducking of the Green George in Bavaria, a rain-charm. Thus the
          priest, as if he were the tree goddess herself, goes from door to
          door dispensing rain and bestowing fruitfulness on each house, but
          especially on the women.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without citing
          more examples to the same effect, we may sum up the result of the
          preceding paragraphs in the words of Mannhardt. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The customs quoted suffice to establish with certainty
          the conclusion that in these spring processions the spirit of
          vegetation is often represented both by the May-tree and in
          addition by a man dressed in green leaves or flowers or by a girl
          similarly adorned. It is the same spirit which animates the tree
          and is active in the inferior plants and which we have recognised
          in the May-tree and the Harvest-May. Quite consistently the spirit
          is also supposed to manifest his presence in the first flower of
          spring and reveals himself both in a girl representing a May-rose,
          and also, as giver of harvest, in the person of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Walber</span></span>. The procession with this
          representative of the divinity was supposed to produce the same
          beneficial effects on the fowls, the fruit-trees, and the crops as
          the presence of the deity himself. In other words, the mummer was
          regarded not as an image but as an actual representative of the
          spirit of vegetation; hence the wish expressed by the attendants on
          the May-rose and the May-tree that those who refuse them gifts of
          eggs, bacon, etc. may have no share in the blessings which it is in
          the power of the itinerant spirit to bestow. We may conclude that
          these begging processions with May-trees or May-boughs from door
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name=
          "Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to door
          (<span class="tei tei-q">‘bringing the May or the summer’</span>)
          had everywhere originally a serious and, so to speak, sacramental
          significance; people really believed that the god of growth was
          present unseen in the bough; by the procession he was brought to
          each house to bestow his blessing. The names May, Father May, May
          Lady, Queen of the May, by which the anthropomorphic spirit of
          vegetation is often denoted, show that the conception of the spirit
          of vegetation is blent with a personification of the season at
          which his powers are most strikingly manifested.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far we have
          seen that the tree-spirit or the spirit of vegetation in general is
          represented either in vegetable form alone, as by a tree, bough, or
          flower; or in vegetable and human form simultaneously, as by a
          tree, bough, or flower in combination with a puppet or a living
          person. It remains to show that the representation of him by a
          tree, bough, or flower is sometimes entirely dropped, while the
          representation of him by a living person remains. In this case the
          representative character of the person is generally marked by
          dressing him or her in leaves or flowers; sometimes too it is
          indicated by the name he or she bears.</p>

          Russia at Whitsuntide a birch-tree is dressed in woman's clothes

          They choose the prettiest of their number, envelop her in a mass of
          foliage taken from the birch-trees and maples, and carry her about
          through the village. In a district of Little Russia they take round

          choose one of their playmates to be the Little Leaf Man. They break
          branches from the trees and twine them about the child till only
          his shoes peep out from the leafy mantle. Holes are made in it for
          him to see through, and two of the children lead the Little Leaf
          Man that he may not stumble or fall. Singing and dancing they take
          him from house to house, asking for gifts of food (eggs, cream,

          all secrecy, lest others should forestall them. Leafy branches are
          twined round two hoops, one of which rests on the shoulders of the
          wearer, the other encircles his calves; holes are made for his eyes
          and mouth; and a large nosegay crowns the whole. In this guise he
          appears suddenly in the village at the hour of vespers, preceded by
          three boys blowing on horns made of willow bark. The great object
          of his supporters is to set up the Whitsuntide Basket beside the
          village well, and to keep it and him there, despite the efforts of
          the lads from neighbouring villages, who seek to carry off the

          children begging. Both are representatives of the beneficent spirit
          of vegetation, whose visit to the house is recompensed by a present

          the May King, Whitsuntide King, Queen of May, and so on. These
          titles, as Mannhardt observes, imply that the spirit incorporate in
          vegetation is a ruler, whose creative power extends far and
          wide.<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a village
          near Salzwedel a May-tree is set up at Whitsuntide and the boys
          race to it; he who reaches it first is king; a garland of flowers
          is put round his neck and in his hand he carries a May-bush, with
          which, as the procession moves along, he sweeps away the dew. At
          each house they sing a song, wishing the inmates good luck,
          referring to the <span class="tei tei-q">“black cow in the stall
          milking white milk, black hen on the nest laying white
          eggs,”</span> and begging a gift of eggs, bacon, etc.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> In
          some villages of Brunswick at Whitsuntide a May King is completely
          enveloped in a May-bush. In some parts of Thüringen also they have
          a May King at Whitsuntide, but he is got up rather differently. A
          frame of wood is made in which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> a man can stand; it is completely covered
          with birch boughs and is surmounted by a crown of birch and
          flowers, in which a bell is fastened. This frame is placed in the
          wood and the May King gets into it. The rest go out and look for
          him, and when they have found him they lead him back into the
          village to the magistrate, the clergyman, and others, who have to
          guess who is in the verdurous frame. If they guess wrong, the May
          King rings his bell by shaking his head, and a forfeit of beer or
          the like must be paid by the unsuccessful guesser.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> In
          some parts of Bohemia on Whit-Monday the young fellows disguise
          themselves in tall caps of birch bark adorned with flowers. One of
          them is dressed as a king and dragged on a sledge to the village
          green, and if on the way they pass a pool the sledge is always
          overturned into it. Arrived at the green they gather round the
          king; the crier jumps on a stone or climbs up a tree and recites
          lampoons about each house and its inmates. Afterwards the disguises
          of bark are stripped off and they go about the village in holiday
          attire, carrying a May-tree and begging. Cakes, eggs, and corn are
          sometimes given them.<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href=
          "#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> At
          Grossvargula, near Langensalza, in last century a Grass King used
          to be led about in procession at Whitsuntide. He was encased in a
          pyramid of poplar branches, the top of which was adorned with a
          royal crown of branches and flowers. He rode on horseback with the
          leafy pyramid over him, so that its lower end touched the ground,
          and an opening was left in it only for his face. Surrounded by a
          cavalcade of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg
          092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          young fellows, he rode in procession to the town hall, the
          parsonage, etc., where they all got a drink of beer. Then under the
          seven lindens of the neighbouring Sommerberg, the Grass King was
          stripped of his green casing; the crown was handed to the Mayor,
          and the branches were stuck in the flax fields in order to make the
          flax grow tall.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href=
          "#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> In
          this last trait the fertilising influence ascribed to the
          representative of the tree-spirit comes out clearly. In the
          neighbourhood of Pilsen (Bohemia) a conical hut of green branches,
          without any door, is erected at Whitsuntide in the midst of the
          village. To this hut rides a troop of village lads with a king at
          their head. He wears a sword at his side and a sugar-loaf hat of
          rushes on his head. In his train are a judge, a crier, and a
          personage called the Frog-flayer or Hangman. This last is a sort of
          ragged merryandrew, wearing a rusty old sword and bestriding a
          sorry hack. On reaching the hut the crier dismounts and goes round
          it looking for a door. Finding none, he says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah, this is perhaps an enchanted castle; the witches
          creep through the leaves and need no door.”</span> At last he draws
          his sword and hews his way into the hut, where there is a chair, on
          which he seats himself and proceeds to criticise in rhyme the
          girls, farmers, and farm-servants of the neighbourhood. When this
          is over, the Frog-flayer steps forward and, after exhibiting a cage
          with frogs in it, sets up a gallows on which he hangs the frogs in
          a row.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href=
          "#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> In
          the neighbourhood of Plas the ceremony differs in some points. The
          king and his soldiers are completely clad in bark, adorned
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name=
          "Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with flowers and
          ribbons; they all carry swords and ride horses, which are gay with
          green branches and flowers. While the village dames and girls are
          being criticised at the arbour, a frog is secretly pinched and
          poked by the crier till it quacks. Sentence of death is passed on
          the frog by the king; the hangman beheads it and flings the
          bleeding body among the spectators. Lastly, the king is driven from
          the hut and pursued by the soldiers.<a id="noteref_320" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> The
          pinching and beheading of the frog are doubtless, as Mannhardt
          observes,<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href=
          "#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          some Indians of the Orinoco beat frogs for the express purpose of
          producing rain, and that killing a frog is a German rain-charm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Often the spirit
          of vegetation in spring is represented by a queen instead of a
          king. In the neighbourhood of Libchowic (Bohemia), on the fourth
          Sunday in Lent, girls dressed in white and wearing the first spring
          flowers, as violets and daisies, in their hair, lead about the
          village a girl who is called the Queen and is crowned with flowers.
          During the procession, which is conducted with great solemnity,
          none of the girls may stand still, but must keep whirling round
          continually and singing. In every house the Queen announces the
          arrival of spring and wishes the inmates good luck and blessings,
          for which she receives presents.<a id="noteref_323" name=

          feasting, dancing, and rustic sports followed, and were closed by a
          grand procession in the evening. During her year of office she
          presided over rural gatherings of young people at dances and
          merrymakings. If she married before next May Day her authority was
          at an end, but her successor was not elected till that day came
          round.<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href=

          of vegetation is sometimes represented by a king and queen, a lord
          and lady, or a bridegroom and bride. Here again the parallelism
          holds between the anthropomorphic and the vegetable representation
          of the tree-spirit, for we have seen above that trees are sometimes

          neighbourhood of Briançon (Dauphiné) on May Day the lads wrap up in
          green leaves a young fellow whose sweetheart has deserted him or
          married another. He lies down on the ground and feigns to be
          asleep. Then a girl who likes him, and would marry him, comes and
          wakes him, and raising him up offers him her arm and a flag. So
          they go to the alehouse, where the pair lead off the dancing. But
          they must marry within the year, or they are treated as old

          this is a Russian custom observed in the district of Nerechta on
          the Thursday before Whitsunday. The girls go out into a birch-wood,
          wind a girdle or band round a stately birch, twist its lower
          branches into a wreath, and kiss each other in pairs through the
          wreath. The girls who kiss through the wreath call each other
          gossips. Then one of the girls steps forward, and mimicking a
          drunken man, flings herself on the ground, rolls on the grass, and
          feigns to go fast asleep. Another girl wakens the pretended sleeper
          and kisses him; then the whole bevy trips singing through the wood
          to twine garlands, which they throw into the water. In the fate of
          the garlands floating on the stream they read their own.<a id=

          this custom the rôle of the sleeper was probably at one time
          sustained by a lad. In these French and Russian customs we have a
          forsaken bridegroom, in the following a forsaken bride. On Shrove
          Tuesday the Slovenes of Oberkrain drag a straw puppet with joyous
          cries up and down the village; then they throw it into the water or
          burn it, and from the height of the flames they judge of the
          abundance of the next harvest. The noisy crew is followed by a
          female masker, who drags a great board by a string and gives out
          that she is a forsaken bride.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Viewed in the
          light of what has gone before, the awakening of the forsaken
          sleeper in these ceremonies probably represents the revival of
          vegetation in spring. But it is not easy to assign their respective
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name=
          "Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> rôles to the
          forsaken bridegroom and to the girl who wakes him from his slumber.
          Is the sleeper the leafless forest or the bare earth of winter? Is
          the girl who wakens him the fresh verdure or the genial sunshine of
          spring? It is hardly possible, on the evidence before us, to answer
          these questions. The Oraons of Bengal, it may be remembered,
          celebrate the marriage of earth in the springtime, when the
          sál-tree is in blossom. But from this we can hardly argue that in
          the European ceremonies the sleeping bridegroom is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the dreaming earth”</span> and the girl the spring
          blossoms.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Highlands
          of Scotland the revival of vegetation in spring used to be
          graphically represented as follows. On Candlemas day (2d February)
          in the Hebrides <span class="tei tei-q">“the mistress and servants
          of each family take a sheaf of oats, and dress it up in women's
          apparel, put it in a large basket, and lay a wooden club by it, and
          this they call Brüd's bed; and then the mistress and servants cry
          three times, Brüd is come, Brüd is welcome. This they do just
          before going to bed, and when they rise in the morning they look
          among the ashes, expecting to see the impression of Brüd's club

          marriage of the spirit of vegetation in spring, though not directly

          in wedding attire. Thus in some villages of Altmark at Whitsuntide,
          while the boys go about carrying a May-tree or leading a boy
          enveloped in leaves and flowers, the girls lead about the May
          Bride, a girl dressed as a bride with a great nosegay in her hair.
          They go from house to house, the May Bride singing a song in which
          she asks for a present, and tells the inmates of each house that if
          they give her something they will themselves have something the
          whole year through; but if they give her nothing they will
          themselves have nothing.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337"

          099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in the customs of our European peasantry. From the remarkable
          persistence and similarity of such customs all over Europe we are
          justified in concluding that tree-worship was once an important
          element in the religion of the Aryan race in Europe, and that the
          rites and ceremonies of the worship were marked by great uniformity
          everywhere, and did not substantially differ from those which are
          still or were till lately observed by our peasants at their spring
          and midsummer festivals. For these rites bear internal marks of
          great antiquity, and this internal evidence is confirmed by the
          resemblance which the rites bear to those of rude peoples
          elsewhere.<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href=
          "#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Therefore it is hardly rash to infer, from this consensus of
          popular customs, that the Greeks and Romans, like the other Aryan
          peoples of Europe, once practised forms of tree-worship similar to
          those which are still kept up by our peasantry. In the palmy days
          of ancient civilisation, no doubt, the worship had sunk to the
          level of vulgar superstition and rustic merrymaking, as it has done
          among ourselves. We need not therefore be surprised that the traces
          of such popular rites are few and slight in ancient literature.
          They are not less so in the polite literature of modern Europe; and
          the negative argument cannot be allowed to go for more in the one
          case than in the other. Enough, however, of positive evidence
          remains to confirm the presumption drawn from analogy. Much of this
          evidence has been collected and analysed with his usual learning
          and judgment by W. Mannhardt.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341"

          I shall content myself with citing certain Greek festivals which
          seem to be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg
          100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the classical equivalents of an English May Day in the olden
          time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every few years
          the Boeotians of Plataea held a festival which they called the
          Little Daedala. On the day of the festival they went out into an
          ancient oak forest, the trees of which were of gigantic girth. Here
          they set some boiled meat on the ground, and watched the birds that
          gathered round it. When a raven was observed to carry off a piece
          of the meat and settle on an oak, the people followed it and cut
          down the tree. With the wood of the tree they made an image,
          dressed it as a bride, and placed it on a bullock-cart with a
          bridesmaid beside it. It seems then to have been drawn to the banks
          of the river Asopus and back to the town, attended by a piping and
          dancing crowd. After the festival the image was put away and kept
          till the celebration of the Great Daedala, which fell only once in
          sixty years. On this great occasion all the images that had
          accumulated from the celebrations of the Little Daedala were
          dragged on carts in solemn procession to the river Asopus, and then
          to the top of Mount Cithaeron. Here an altar had been constructed
          of square blocks of wood fitted together and surmounted by a heap
          of brushwood. Animals were sacrificed by being burned on the altar,
          and the altar itself, together with the images, were consumed by
          the flames. The blaze, we are told, rose to a prodigious height and
          was seen for many miles. To explain the origin of the festival it
          was said that once upon a time Hera had quarrelled with Zeus and
          left him in high dudgeon. To lure her back Zeus gave out that he
          was about to marry the nymph Plataea, daughter of the river Asopus.
          He caused a wooden image to be made, dressed and veiled as a bride,
          and conveyed on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
          101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
          bullock-cart. Transported with rage and jealousy, Hera flew to the
          cart, and tearing off the veil of the pretended bride, discovered
          the deceit that had been practised on her. Her rage was now changed
          to laughter, and she became reconciled to her husband Zeus.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The resemblance
          of this festival to some of the European spring and midsummer
          festivals is tolerably close. We have seen that in Russia at
          Whitsuntide the villagers go out into the wood, fell a birch-tree,
          dress it in woman's clothes, and bring it back to the village with
          dance and song. On the third day it is thrown into the water.<a id=
          "noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>
          Again, we have seen that in Bohemia on Midsummer Eve the village
          lads fell a tall fir or pine-tree in the wood and set it up on a
          height, where it is adorned with garlands, nosegays, and ribbons,
          and afterwards burnt.<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href=
          "#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a> The
          reason for burning the tree will appear afterwards; the custom
          itself is not uncommon in modern Europe. In some parts of the
          Pyrenees a tall and slender tree is cut down on May Day and kept
          till Midsummer Eve. It is then rolled to the top of a hill, set up,
          and burned.<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href=

          bonfire on midsummer-eve; a large summer pole was fixed in the

          the top of it.”</span><a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Probably the
          Boeotian festival belonged to the same class of rites. It
          represented the marriage of the powers of vegetation in spring or
          midsummer, just as the same event is represented in modern Europe
          by a King and Queen or a Lord and Lady of the May. In the Boeotian,
          as in the Russian, ceremony the tree dressed as a woman represents
          the English May-pole and May-queen in one. All such ceremonies, it
          must be remembered, are not, or at least were not originally, mere
          spectacular or dramatic exhibitions. They are magical charms
          designed to produce the effect which they dramatically represent.
          If the revival of vegetation in spring is represented by the
          awakening of a sleeper, the representation is intended actually to
          quicken the growth of leaves and blossoms; if the marriage of the
          powers of vegetation is represented by a King and Queen of May, the
          idea is that the powers so represented will really be rendered more
          productive by the ceremony. In short, all these spring and
          midsummer festivals fall under the head of sympathetic magic. The
          event which it is desired to bring about is represented
          dramatically, and the very representation is believed to effect, or
          at least to contribute to, the production of the desired event. In
          the case of the Daedala the story of Hera's quarrel with Zeus and
          her sullen retirement may perhaps without straining be interpreted
          as a mythical expression for a bad season and the failure of the
          crops. The same disastrous effects were attributed to the anger and
          seclusion of Demeter after the loss of her daughter
          Proserpine.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href=
          "#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> Now
          the institution of a festival is often explained by a mythical
          story of the occurrence upon a particular occasion of those very
          calamities which it is the real <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> object of the festival to avert; so that if
          we know the myth told to account for the historical origin of the
          festival, we can often infer from it the real intention with which
          the festival was celebrated. If, therefore, the origin of the
          Daedala was explained by a story of a failure of crops and
          consequent famine, we may infer that the real object of the
          festival was to prevent the occurrence of such disasters; and, if I
          am right in my interpretation of the festival, the object was
          supposed to be effected by a dramatic representation of the
          marriage of the divinities most concerned with the production of
          vegetation.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href=
          "#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> The
          marriage of Zeus and Hera was dramatically represented at annual
          festivals in various parts of Greece,<a id="noteref_351" name=
          "noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> and
          it is at least a fair conjecture that the nature and intention of
          these ceremonies were such as I have assigned to the Plataean
          festival of the Daedala; in other words, that Zeus and Hera at
          these festivals were the Greek equivalents of the Lord and Lady of
          the May. Homer's glowing picture of Zeus and Hera couched on fresh
          hyacinths and crocuses,<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href=
          "#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a> like
          Milton's description of the dalliance of Zephyr and Aurora,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“as he met her once a-Maying,”</span> was
          perhaps painted from the life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still more
          confidently may the same character be vindicated for the annual
          marriage at Athens of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg
          104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Queen to Dionysus in the Flowery Month (<span lang="el" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Anthesterion</span></span>) of spring.<a id=
          "noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> For
          Dionysus, as we shall see later on, was essentially a god of
          vegetation, and the Queen at Athens was a purely religious or
          priestly functionary.<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href=
          "#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a>
          Therefore at their annual marriage in spring he can hardly have
          been anything but a King, and she a Queen, of May. The women who
          attended the Queen at the marriage ceremony would correspond to the
          bridesmaids who wait on the May-queen.<a id="noteref_355" name=
          "noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a>
          Again, the story, dear to poets and artists, of the forsaken and
          sleeping Ariadne waked and wedded by Dionysus, resembles so closely
          the little drama acted by French peasants of the Alps on May
          Day<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href=
          "#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> that,
          considering the character of Dionysus as a god of vegetation, we
          can hardly help regarding it as the description of a spring
          ceremony corresponding to the French one. In point of fact the
          marriage of Dionysus and Ariadne is believed by Preller to have
          been acted every spring in Crete.<a id="noteref_357" name=
          "noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a> His
          evidence, indeed, is inconclusive, but the view itself is probable.
          If I am right in instituting the comparison, the chief difference
          between the French and the Greek ceremonies must have been that in
          the former the sleeper was the forsaken bridegroom, in the latter
          the forsaken bride; and the group of stars in the sky, in which
          fancy saw Ariadne's wedding-crown,<a id="noteref_358" name=
          "noteref_358" href="#note_358"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> could
          only have been a translation to heaven of the garland worn by the
          Greek girl who played the Queen of May.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole,
          alike from the analogy of modern <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> folk-custom and from the facts of ancient
          ritual and mythology, we are justified in concluding that the
          archaic forms of tree-worship disclosed by the spring and midsummer
          festivals of our peasants were practised by the Greeks and Romans
          in prehistoric times. Do then these forms of tree-worship help to
          explain the priesthood of Aricia, the subject of our inquiry? I
          believe they do. In the first place the attributes of Diana, the
          goddess of the Arician grove, are those of a tree-spirit or sylvan
          deity. Her sanctuaries were in groves, indeed every grove was her
          sanctuary,<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href=

          a tree-spirit, she helped women in travail, and in this respect her
          reputation appears to have stood high at the Arician grove, if we

          as in Finland the wood-god Tapio was believed to care for the wild
          creatures that roamed the wood, they being considered his
          cattle.<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a> So,
          too, the Samogitians deemed the birds and beasts of the woods
          sacred, doubtless because they were under the protection of the god
          of the wood.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href=
          "#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Again, there are indications that domestic cattle were protected by
          Diana,<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href=
          "#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> as
          they certainly were supposed to be by Silvanus.<a id="noteref_366"

          we have seen that special influence over cattle is ascribed to
          wood-spirits; in Finland the herds enjoyed the protection of the
          wood-gods both while they were <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Lastly, in the sacred spring which bubbled, and the perpetual fire
          which seems to have burned in the Arician grove,<a id="noteref_368"

          may perhaps detect traces of other attributes of forest gods, the
          power, namely, to make the rain to fall and the sun to shine.<a id=

          last attribute perhaps explains why Virbius, the companion deity of
          Diana at Nemi, was by some believed to be the sun.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the cult of
          the Arician grove was essentially that of a tree-spirit or wood
          deity. But our examination of European folk-custom demonstrated
          that a tree-spirit is frequently represented by a living person,
          who is regarded as an embodiment of the tree-spirit and possessed
          of its fertilising powers; and our previous survey of primitive
          belief proved that this conception of a god incarnate in a living
          man is common among rude races. Further we have seen that the
          living person who is believed to embody in himself the tree-spirit
          is often called a king, in which respect, again, he strictly
          represents the tree-spirit. For the sacred cedar of the Gilgit
          tribes is called, as we have seen, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Dreadful King”</span>;<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href=
          "#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a> and
          the chief forest god of the Finns, by name Tapio, represented as an
          old man with a brown beard, a high hat of fir-cones and a coat of
          tree-moss, was styled the Wood King, Lord of the Woodland, Golden
          King of the Wood.<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href=
          "#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> May
          not then the King of the Wood in the Arician grove have been, like
          the King of May, the Grass King, and the like, an incarnation of
          the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation? His title, his sacred
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name=
          "Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> office, and his
          residence in the grove all point to this conclusion, which is
          confirmed by his relation to the Golden Bough. For since the King
          of the Wood could only be assailed by him who had plucked the
          Golden Bough, his life was safe from assault so long as the bough
          or the tree on which it grew remained uninjured. In a sense,
          therefore, his life was bound up with that of the tree; and thus to
          some extent he stood to the tree in the same relation in which the
          incorporate or immanent tree-spirit stands to it. The
          representation of the tree-spirit both by the King of the Wood and
          by the Golden Bough (for it will hardly be disputed that the Golden
          Bough was looked upon as a very special manifestation of the divine
          life of the grove) need not surprise us, since we have found that
          the tree-spirit is not unfrequently thus represented in double,
          first by a tree or a bough, and second by a living person.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole
          then, if we consider his double character as king and priest, his
          relation to the Golden Bough, and the strictly woodland character
          of the divinity of the grove, we may provisionally assume that the
          King of the Wood, like the May King and his congeners of Northern
          Europe, was deemed a living incarnation of the tree-spirit. As such
          he would be credited with those miraculous powers of sending rain
          and sunshine, making the crops to grow, women to bring forth, and
          flocks and herds to multiply, which are popularly ascribed to the
          tree-spirit itself. The reputed possessor of powers so exalted must
          have been a very important personage, and in point of fact his
          influence appears to have extended far and wide. For<a id=

          tribes who composed the Latin League, the sacred grove on the Alban
          Mountain is known to have been an object of their common reverence
          and care. And just as the kings of Cambodia used to send offerings
          to the mystic Kings of Fire and Water far in the dim depths of the
          tropical forest, so, we may well believe, from all sides of the
          broad Latian plain the eyes and steps of Italian pilgrims turned to
          the quarter where, standing sharply out against the faint blue line
          of the Apennines or the deeper blue of the distant sea, the Alban
          Mountain rose before them, the home of the mysterious priest of
          Nemi, the King of the Wood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
          chapter we saw that in early society the king or priest is often
          thought to be endowed with supernatural powers or to be an
          incarnation of a deity; in consequence of which the course of
          nature is supposed to be more or less under his control, and he is
          held responsible for bad weather, failure of the crops, and similar
          calamities. Thus far it appears to be assumed that the king's power
          over nature, like that over his subjects and slaves, is exerted
          through definite acts of will; and therefore if drought, famine,
          pestilence, or storms arise, the people attribute the misfortune to
          the negligence or guilt of their king, and punish him accordingly
          with stripes and bonds, or, if he remains obdurate, with deposition
          and death. Sometimes, however, the course of nature, while regarded
          as dependent on the king, is supposed to be partly independent of
          his will. His person is considered, if we may express it so, as the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name=
          "Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dynamical centre of
          the universe, from which lines of force radiate to all quarters of
          the heaven; so that any motion of his—the turning of his head, the
          lifting of his hand—instantaneously affects and may seriously
          disturb some part of nature. He is the point of support on which
          hangs the balance of the world; and the slightest irregularity on
          his part may overthrow the delicate equipoise. The greatest care
          must, therefore, be taken both by and of him; and his whole life,
          down to its minutest details, must be so regulated that no act of
          his, voluntary or involuntary, may disarrange or upset the
          established order of nature. Of this class of monarchs the Mikado
          or Dairi, the spiritual emperor of Japan, is a typical example. He
          is an incarnation of the sun goddess, the deity who rules the
          universe, gods and men included; once a year all the gods wait upon
          him and spend a month at his court. During that month, the name of
          which means <span class="tei tei-q">“without gods,”</span> no one
          frequents the temples, for they are believed to be deserted.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
          description of the Mikado's mode of life was written about two
          hundred years ago:<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href=

          more particularly those who sit on the throne, are looked upon as
          persons most holy in themselves, and as Popes by birth. And, in
          order to preserve these advantageous notions in the minds of their
          subjects, they are obliged to take an uncommon care of their sacred
          persons, and to do such things, which, examined according to the
          customs of other nations, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg

          would be thought ridiculous and impertinent. It will not be
          improper to give a few instances of it. He thinks that it would be
          very prejudicial to his dignity and holiness to touch the ground
          with his feet; for this reason, when he intends to go anywhere, he
          must be carried thither on men's shoulders. Much less will they
          suffer that he should expose his sacred person to the open air, and
          the sun is not thought worthy to shine on his head. There is such a
          holiness ascribed to all the parts of his body, that he dares to
          cut off neither his hair, nor his beard, nor his nails. However,
          lest he should grow too dirty, they may clean him in the night when
          he is asleep; because, they say, that which is taken from his body
          at that time hath been stolen from him, and that such a theft doth
          not prejudice his holiness or dignity. In ancient times, he was
          obliged to sit on the throne for some hours every morning, with the
          imperial crown on his head, but to sit altogether like a statue,
          without stirring either hands or feet, head or eyes, nor indeed any
          part of his body, because, by this means, it was thought that he
          could preserve peace and tranquillity in his empire; for if,
          unfortunately, he turned himself on one side or the other, or if he
          looked a good while towards any part of his dominions, it was
          apprehended that war, famine, fire, or some great misfortune was
          near at hand to desolate the country. But it having been afterwards
          discovered that the imperial crown was the palladium which by its
          mobility could preserve peace in the empire, it was thought
          expedient to deliver his imperial person, consecrated only to
          idleness and pleasures, from this burthensome duty, and therefore
          the crown is at present placed on the throne for some hours every
          morning. His victuals must be dressed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          in new dishes: both are very clean and neat, but made only of
          common clay; that without any considerable expense they may be laid
          aside, or broken, after they have served once. They are generally
          broke, for fear they should come into the hands of laymen, for they
          believe religiously that if any layman should presume to eat his
          food out of these sacred dishes, it would swell and inflame his
          mouth and throat. The like ill effect is dreaded from the Dairi's
          sacred habits; for they believe that if a layman should wear them,
          without the Emperor's express leave or command, they would occasion
          swellings and pains in all parts of his body.”</span> To the same
          effect an earlier account of the Mikado says: <span class=

          even to touch the ground with his foot. The sun and moon were not
          even permitted to shine upon his head. None of the superfluities of
          the body were ever taken from him, neither his hair, his beard, nor
          his nails were cut. Whatever he eat was dressed in new

          misfortunes would befall them if they broke this rule. When he left

          married people had to observe strict continence the whole time he
          was out; for it was supposed that any act of incontinence would
          prove fatal to him. And if he were to die a natural death, they

          the high pontiff of the Zapotecs in Southern Mexico appears to have
          presented a still closer parallel to the Mikado. A powerful rival
          to the king himself, this spiritual lord governed Yopaa, one of the
          chief cities of the kingdom, with absolute dominion. It is
          impossible, we are told, to over-rate the reverence in which he was
          held. He was looked on as a god whom the earth was not worthy to
          hold nor the sun to shine upon. He profaned his sanctity if he even
          touched the ground with his foot. The officers who bore his
          palanquin on their shoulders were members of the highest families;
          he hardly deigned to look on anything <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> around him; and all who met him fell with
          their faces to the earth, fearing that death would overtake them if
          they saw even his shadow. A rule of continence was regularly
          imposed on the Zapotec priests, especially upon the high pontiff;
          but <span class="tei tei-q">“on certain days in each year, which
          were generally celebrated with feasts and dances, it was customary
          for the high priest to become drunk. While in this state, seeming
          to belong neither to heaven nor to earth, one of the most beautiful
          of the virgins consecrated to the service of the gods was brought
          to him.”</span> If the child she bore him was a son, he was brought
          up as a prince of the blood, and the eldest son succeeded his
          father on the pontifical throne.<a id="noteref_380" name=

          supernatural powers attributed to this pontiff are not specified,
          but probably they resembled those of the Mikado and Chitomé.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wherever, as in
          Japan and West Africa, it is supposed that the order of nature, and
          even the existence of the world, is bound up with the life of the
          king or priest, it is clear that he must be regarded by his
          subjects as a source both of infinite blessing and of infinite
          danger. On the one hand, the people have to thank him for the rain
          and sunshine which foster the fruits of the earth, for the wind
          which brings ships to their coasts, and even for the existence of
          the earth beneath their feet. But what he gives he can refuse; and
          so close is the dependence of nature on his person, so delicate the
          balance of the system of forces whereof he is the centre, that the
          slightest irregularity on his part may set up a tremor which shall
          shake the earth to its foundations. And <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> if nature may be disturbed by the slightest
          involuntary act of the king, it is easy to conceive the convulsion
          which his death might occasion. The death of the Chitomé, as we
          have seen, was thought to entail the destruction of the world.
          Clearly, therefore, out of a regard for their own safety, which
          might be imperilled by any rash act of the king, and still more by
          his death, the people will exact of their king or priest a strict
          conformity to those rules, the observance of which is necessary for
          his own preservation, and consequently for the preservation of his
          people and the world. The idea that early kingdoms are despotisms
          in which the people exist only for the sovereign, is wholly
          inapplicable to the monarchies we are considering. On the contrary,
          the sovereign in them exists only for his subjects; his life is
          only valuable so long as he discharges the duties of his position
          by ordering the course of nature for his people's benefit. So soon
          as he fails to do so the care, the devotion, the religious homage
          which they had hitherto lavished on him, cease and are changed into
          hatred and contempt; he is dismissed ignominiously, and may be
          thankful if he escapes with his life. Worshipped as a god by them
          one day, he is killed by them as a criminal the next. But in this
          changed behaviour of the people there is nothing capricious or
          inconsistent. On the contrary, their conduct is entirely of a
          piece. If their king is their god, he is or should be also their
          preserver; and if he will not preserve them, he must make room for
          another who will. So long, however, as he answers their
          expectations, there is no limit to the care which they take of him,
          and which they compel him to take of himself. A king of this sort
          lives hedged in by a ceremonious <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> etiquette, a network of prohibitions and
          observances, of which the intention is not to contribute to his
          dignity, much less to his comfort, but to restrain him from conduct
          which, by disturbing the harmony of nature, might involve himself,
          his people, and the universe in one common catastrophe. Far from
          adding to his comfort, these observances, by trammelling his every
          act, annihilate his freedom and often render the very life, which
          it is their object to preserve, a burden and sorrow to him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the
          supernaturally endowed kings of Loango it is said that the more
          powerful a king is, the more taboos is he bound to observe; they

          hours both of day and night were arranged at which the king had to

          prescribed quantity of wine.”</span> Of the taboos imposed on
          priests, the rules of life observed by the Flamen Dialis at Rome
          furnish a striking example. As the worship of Virbius at Nemi was
          conducted, as we have seen,<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385"
          href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> by a
          Flamen, who may possibly have been the King of the Wood himself,
          and whose mode of life may have resembled that of the Roman Flamen,
          these rules have a special interest for us. They were such as the
          following: The Flamen Dialis might not ride or even touch a horse,
          nor see an army under arms, nor wear a ring which was not broken,
          nor have a knot on any part of his garments; no fire except a
          sacred fire might be taken out of his house; he might not touch
          wheaten flour or leavened bread; he might not touch or even name a
          goat, a dog, raw meat, beans, and ivy; he might not walk under a
          vine; the feet of his bed had to be daubed with mud; his hair could
          be cut only by a free man and with a bronze knife, and his hair and
          nails when cut had to be buried under a lucky tree; he might not
          touch a dead body nor enter a place where one was burned; he might
          not see work being done on holy days; he might not be uncovered in
          the open air; if a man in bonds were taken into his house, he had
          to be unbound and the cords had to be drawn up through a hole in
          the roof and so let down into the street. His wife, the Flaminica,
          had to observe nearly the same rules, and others of her own
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name=
          "Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> besides. She might
          not ascend more than three steps of the kind of staircase called
          Greek; at a certain festival she might not comb her hair; the
          leather of her shoes might not be made from a beast that had died a
          natural death, but only from one that had been slain or sacrificed;
          if she heard thunder she was tabooed till she had offered an
          expiatory sacrifice.<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The burdensome
          observances attached to the royal or priestly office produced their
          natural effect. Either men refused to accept the office, which
          hence tended to fall into abeyance; or accepting it, they sank
          under its weight into spiritless creatures, cloistered recluses,
          from whose nerveless fingers the reigns of government slipped into
          the firmer grasp of men who were often content to wield the reality
          of sovereignty without its name. In some countries this rift in the
          supreme power deepened into a total and permanent separation of the
          spiritual and temporal powers, the old royal house retaining their
          purely religious functions, while the civil government passed into
          the hands of a younger and more vigorous race.</p>

          in Cambodia it is often necessary to force the kingships of Fire

          kept in durance till he consents to accept the crown. Sometimes the
          heir finds means of evading the honour which it is sought to thrust
          upon him; a ferocious chief has been known to go about constantly
          armed, resolute to resist by force any attempt to set him on the
          throne.<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href=

          Mikados of Japan seem early to have resorted to the expedient of
          transferring the honours and burdens of supreme power to their
          infant children; and the rise of the Tycoons, long the temporal
          sovereigns of the country, is traced to the abdication of a certain
          Mikado in favour of his three-year-old son. The sovereignty having
          been wrested by a usurper from the infant prince, the cause of the
          Mikado was championed by Yoritomo, a man of spirit and conduct, who
          overthrew the usurper and restored to the Mikado the shadow, while
          he retained for himself the substance, of power. He bequeathed to
          his descendants the dignity he had won, and thus became the founder
          of the line of Tycoons. Down to the latter half of the sixteenth
          century the Tycoons were active and efficient rulers; but the same
          fate overtook them which had befallen the Mikados; entangled in the
          same inextricable web of custom and law, they degenerated into mere
          puppets, hardly stirring from their palaces and occupied in a
          perpetual round of empty ceremonies, while the real business of
          government was managed by the council of state.<a id="noteref_390"

          Tonquin the monarchy ran a similar course. Living like his
          predecessors in effeminacy and sloth, the king was driven from the
          throne by an ambitious adventurer named Mack, who from a fisherman
          had risen to be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg
          120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Grand Mandarin. But the king's brother Tring put down the usurper
          and restored the king, retaining, however, for himself and his
          descendants the dignity of general of all the forces. Thenceforward
          the kings or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">dovas</span></span>, though vested with the
          title and pomp of sovereignty, ceased to govern. While they lived
          secluded in their palaces, all real political power was wielded by

          the birth of a son, who was immediately proclaimed sovereign and
          received his father's homage, may perhaps have originated, like the
          similar custom occasionally practised by the Mikados, in a wish to
          shift to other shoulders the irksome burden of royalty; for in
          Tahiti as elsewhere the sovereign was subjected to a system of
          vexatious restrictions.<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href=

          entrusted from time to time to a victorious war-chief, whose
          investiture, however, had to be completed by the king. To the
          latter were assigned the best lands, and he received daily

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if the
          object of the taboos observed by a divine king or priest is to
          preserve his life, the question arises, How is their observance
          supposed to effect this end? To understand this we must know the
          nature of the danger which threatens the king's life, and which it
          is the intention of the taboos to guard against. We must,
          therefore, ask: What does early man understand by death? To what
          causes does he attribute it? And how does he think it may be
          guarded against?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the savage
          commonly explains the processes of inanimate nature by supposing
          that they are produced by living beings working in or behind the
          phenomena, so he explains the phenomena of life itself. If an
          animal lives and moves, it can only be, he thinks, because there is
          a little animal inside which moves it. If a man lives and moves, it
          can only be because he has a little man inside who moves him. The
          animal inside the animal, the man inside the man, is the soul. And
          as the activity of an animal or man is explained by the presence of
          the soul, so the repose of sleep or death is explained by its
          absence; sleep or trance being the temporary, death being the
          permanent absence of the soul. Hence if death be the permanent
          absence of the soul, the way to guard against it is either to
          prevent the soul from leaving the body, or, if it does depart, to
          secure that it shall return. The precautions adopted by savages to
          secure one or other of these ends take the form of prohibitions or
          taboos, which are nothing but rules intended to ensure either the
          continued presence or the return of the soul. In short, they are
          life-preservers or life-guards. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, yes. We also are two, we also have a

          little body went after death, some said it went behind the bush,
          others said it went into the sea, and some said they did not

          think that every man, before he is born, is asked how long or how
          heavy a soul he would like, and a soul of the desired weight or

          one of them might swallow the child's soul. For a similar reason
          all persons present in the house, even the mother herself, are
          obliged to keep their mouths shut the whole time the birth is
          taking place. When the question was put, Why they did not hold
          their noses also, lest the child's soul should get into one of

          question to its practical conclusion. If the soul is a bird on the
          wing, it may be attracted by rice, and so prevented from taking its
          perilous flight. Thus in Java when a child is placed on the ground
          for the first time (a moment which uncultured people seem to regard
          as especially dangerous), it is put in a hen-coop and the mother

          Amongst the Battas of Sumatra, when a man returns from a dangerous

          strewed on the head of the person in whose honour the festival is
          held, with the object of detaining his soul, which at such times is

          sleeper is supposed to wander away from his body and actually to
          visit the very places of which he dreams. But this absence of the

          permanently detained away from the body, the person, deprived of

          The Santals tell how a man fell asleep, and growing very thirsty,
          his soul, in the form of a lizard, left his body and entered a
          pitcher of water to drink. Just then the owner of the pitcher
          happened to cover it; so the soul could not return to the body and
          the man died. While his friends were preparing to burn the body
          some one uncovered the pitcher to get water. The lizard thus
          escaped and returned to the body, which immediately revived; so the
          man rose up and asked his friends why they were weeping. They told
          him they thought he was dead and were about to burn his body. He
          said he had been down a well to get water but had found it hard to
          get out and had just returned. So they saw it all.<a id=

          similar story is reported from Transylvania as follows. In the
          account of a witch's trial at Mühlbach last century it is said that
          a woman had engaged two men to work in her vineyard. After noon
          they all lay down to rest as usual. An hour later the men got up
          and tried to waken the woman, but could not. She lay motionless
          with her mouth wide open. They came back at sunset and still she
          lay like a corpse. Just at that moment a big fly came buzzing past,
          which one of the men caught and shut up in his leathern pouch. Then
          they tried again to waken the woman but could not. Afterwards they
          let out the fly; it flew straight into the woman's mouth and she
          awoke. On seeing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
          127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a common
          rule with primitive people not to waken a sleeper, because his soul
          is away and might not have time to get back; so if the man wakened
          without his soul, he would fall sick. If it is absolutely necessary
          to waken a sleeper, it must be done very gradually, to allow the
          soul time to return.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href=

          Bombay it is thought equivalent to murder to change the appearance
          of a sleeper, as by painting his face in fantastic colours or
          giving moustaches to a sleeping woman. For when the soul returns,
          it will not be able to recognise its body and the person will
          die.<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href=

          Servians believe that the soul of a sleeping witch often leaves her
          body in the form of a butterfly. If during its absence her body be
          turned round, so that her feet are placed where her head was
          before, the butterfly soul will not find its way back into her body
          through the mouth, and the witch will die.<a id="noteref_418" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in order
          that a man's soul should quit his body, it is not necessary that he
          should be asleep. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg

          It may quit him in his waking hours, and then sickness or (if the
          absence is prolonged) death will be the result. Thus the Mongols
          sometimes explain sickness by supposing that the patient's soul is
          absent, and either does not care to return to its body or cannot
          find the way back. To secure the return of the soul it is therefore
          necessary on the one hand to make its body as attractive as
          possible, and on the other hand to show it the way home. To make
          the body attractive all the sick man's best clothes and most valued
          possessions are placed beside him; he is washed, incensed, and made
          as comfortable as possible; and all his friends march thrice round
          the hut calling out the sick man's name and coaxing his soul to
          return. To help the soul to find its way back a coloured cord is
          stretched from the patient's head to the door of the hut. The
          priest in his robes reads a list of the horrors of hell and the
          dangers incurred by souls which wilfully absent themselves from
          their bodies. Then turning to the assembled friends and the patient
          he asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it come?”</span> All answer
          Yes, and bowing to the returning soul throw seed over the sick man.
          The cord which guided the soul back is then rolled up and placed
          round the patient's neck, who must wear it for seven days without
          taking it off. No one may frighten or hurt him, lest his soul, not
          yet familiar with its body, should again take flight.<a id=

          Further, on returning from the grave each Karen provides himself
          with three little hooks made of branches of trees, and calling his
          spirit to follow him, at short intervals, as he returns, he makes a
          motion as if hooking it, and then thrusts the hook into the ground.
          This is done to prevent the soul of the living from staying behind

          a mother dies leaving a young baby, the Burmese think that the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“butterfly”</span> or soul of the baby
          follows that of the mother, and that if it is not recovered the
          child must die. So a wise woman is called in to get back the baby's
          soul. She places a mirror near the corpse, and on the mirror a
          piece of feathery cotton down. Holding a cloth in her open hands at
          the foot of the mirror, she with wild words entreats the mother not
          to take with her the <span class="tei tei-q">“butterfly”</span> or
          soul of her child, but to send it back. As the gossamer down slips
          from the face of the mirror she catches it in the cloth and
          tenderly places it on the baby's breast. The same ceremony is
          sometimes observed when one of two children that have played
          together dies, and is thought to be luring away the soul of its
          playmate to the spirit-land. It is sometimes performed also for a
          bereaved husband or wife.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Bolang
          Mongondo, a district in the west of Celebes, all sickness is
          ascribed to the ancestral spirits who have carried off the
          patient's soul. The object therefore is to bring back the patient's
          soul and restore it to the sufferer. An eye-witness has thus
          described the attempted cure of a sick boy. The priestesses, who
          acted as physicians, made a doll of cloth and fastened it to the
          point of a spear, which an old woman held upright. Round this doll
          the priestesses danced, uttering charms, and chirruping as when one
          calls a dog. Then the old woman lowered the point of the spear a
          little, so that the priestesses could reach the doll. By this time
          the soul of the sick boy was supposed to be in the doll, having
          been brought into it by the incantations. So the priestesses
          approached it cautiously on tiptoe and caught the soul in the
          many-coloured cloths which they had been waving in the air. Then
          they laid the soul on the boy's head, that is, they wrapped his
          head in the cloth in which the soul was supposed to be, and stood
          still for some moments with great gravity, holding their hands on
          the patient's head. Suddenly there was a jerk, the priestesses
          whispered and shook their heads, and the cloth was taken off—the
          soul had escaped. The priestesses gave chase to it, running round
          and round the house, clucking and gesticulating as if they were
          driving hens into a poultry-yard. At last they recaptured the soul
          at the foot of the stair and restored it to its owner as
          before.<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href=

          For when a man was sick the soul-doctor would go with a large troop
          of men and women to the graveyard. Here the men played on flutes
          and the women whistled softly to lure the soul home. After this had
          gone on for some time they formed in procession and moved
          homewards, the flutes playing and the women whistling all the way,
          leading back the wandering soul and driving it gently along with
          open palms. On entering the patient's dwelling they commanded the
          soul in a loud voice to enter his body.<a id="noteref_430" name=

          saying they clapped a bonnet on the hole, and folding up the soul
          in the bonnet, brought it to the patient, who put the bonnet on his
          head, and thus received a new soul or got back his old one.<a id=

          the Moluccas when a man is unwell it is thought that some devil has
          carried away his soul to the tree, mountain, or hill where he (the
          devil) dwells. A sorcerer having pointed out the devil's abode, the
          friends of the patient carry thither cooked rice, fruit, fish, raw
          eggs, a hen, a chicken, a silken robe, gold, armlets, etc. Having
          set out the food in order they pray, saying: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We come to offer to you, O devil, this offering of
          food, clothes, gold, etc.; take it and release the soul of the
          patient for whom we pray. Let it return to his body and he who now
          is sick shall be made whole.”</span> Then they eat a little and let
          the hen loose as a ransom for the soul of the patient; also they
          put down the raw eggs; but the silken robe, the gold, and the
          armlets they take home with them. As soon as they are come to the
          house they place a flat bowl containing the offerings which have
          been brought back at the sick man's head, and say to him:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now is your soul released, and you shall

          more modern account from the same region describes how the friend
          of the patient, after depositing his offerings on the spot where
          the missing soul is supposed to be, calls out thrice the name of
          the sick person, adding, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come with me,
          come with me.”</span> Then he returns, making a motion with a cloth
          as if he had caught the soul in it. He must not look to right or
          left or speak a word to any one he meets, but must go straight to
          the patient's house. At the door he stands, and calling out the
          sick <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name=
          "Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> person's name, asks
          whether he is returned. Being answered from within that he is
          returned, he enters and lays the cloth in which he has caught the
          soul on the patient's throat, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now
          you are returned to the house.”</span> Sometimes a substitute is
          provided; a doll, dressed up in gay clothing and tinsel, is offered
          to the demon in exchange for the patient's soul with these words,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us back the ugly one which you have
          taken away and receive this pretty one instead.”</span><a id=

          Similarly the Mongols make up a horse of birch-bark and a doll, and
          invite the demon to take the doll instead of the patient and to

          performs a ceremony for the purpose of restoring their souls to the
          inmates. He hangs up a bag at the place of sacrifice and then goes
          through a list of the gods. There are so many of them that this
          takes him the whole night through without stopping. In the morning
          he offers the gods an egg and some rice. By this time the souls of
          the household are supposed to be gathered in the bag. So the priest
          takes the bag, and holding it on the head of the master of the
          house says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here you have your soul—go

          It was wrapped in a leaf, and had been passed from the gods inside
          the house to those sitting in the doorway. One of the gods handed
          the soul to one of the wizards, taking him for a god in the dark,
          for it was night. Then all the gods rose up and went away; but the
          wizard kept the chief's soul. In the morning some women went with a
          present of fine mats to fetch a famous physician. The wizards were
          sitting on the shore as the women passed, and they said to the
          women, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us the mats and we will heal
          him.”</span> So they went to the chief's house. He was very ill,
          his jaw hung down, and his end seemed near. But the wizards undid
          the leaf and let the soul into him again, and forthwith he

          be separated for a time from his body without causing death and
          without the man being aware of his loss. It is necessary, however,
          that the lost soul should be soon found and restored to the man or
          he will die. The name of the man who has lost his soul is revealed
          in a dream to the medicine-man, who hastens to inform the sufferer
          of his loss. Generally a number of men have sustained a like loss
          at the same time; all their names are revealed to the medicine-man,
          and all employ him to recover their souls. The whole night long
          these soulless men go about the village from lodge to lodge,
          dancing and singing. Towards daybreak they go into a separate

          brushes in the souls, in the shape of bits of bone and the like,
          which he receives on a piece of matting. A fire is next kindled, by
          the light of which the medicine-man sorts out the souls. First he
          puts aside the souls of dead people, of which there are usually
          several; for if he were to give the soul of a dead person to a
          living man, the man would die instantly. Next he picks out the
          souls of all the persons present, and making them all to sit down
          before him, he takes the soul of each, in the shape of a splinter
          of bone, wood, or shell, and placing it on the owner's head, pats
          it with many prayers and contortions till it descends into the

          possible that even in lands outside the tropics the fact of the

          Clearly in these cases the shadow, if not equivalent to the soul,
          is at least regarded as a living part of the man or the animal, so
          that injury done to the shadow is felt by the person or animal as
          if it were done to his body. Whoever entered the sanctuary of Zeus
          on Mount Lycaeus in Arcadia was believed to lose his shadow and to
          die within the year.<a id="noteref_468" name="noteref_468" href=

          Nowhere, perhaps, does the equivalence of the shadow to the life or
          soul come out more clearly than in some <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> customs practised to this day in
          South-Eastern Europe. In modern Greece, when the foundation of a
          new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, a ram,
          or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation stone, under
          which the animal is afterwards buried. The object of the sacrifice
          is to give strength and stability to the building. But sometimes,
          instead of killing an animal, the builder entices a man to the
          foundation stone, secretly measures his body, or a part of it, or
          his shadow, and buries the measure under the foundation stone; or
          he lays the foundation stone upon the man's shadow. It is believed
          that the man will die within the year.<a id="noteref_469" name=

          Bulgarians still observe a similar custom. If they cannot get a
          human shadow they measure the shadow of the first animal that comes
          that way.<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href=

          Roumanians of Transylvania think that he whose shadow is thus
          immured will die within forty days; so persons passing by a
          building which is in course of erection may hear a warning cry,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Beware lest they take thy shadow!”</span>
          Not long ago there were still shadow-traders whose business it was
          to provide architects with the shadows necessary for securing their
          walls.<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a> In
          these cases the measure of the shadow is looked on as equivalent to
          the shadow itself, and to bury it is to bury the life or soul of
          the man, who, deprived of it, must die. Thus the custom is a
          substitute for the old custom of immuring a living person in the
          walls, or crushing him under the foundation stone of a new
          building, in order to give strength and durability to the
          structure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can now
          understand why it was a maxim both in ancient India and ancient
          Greece not to look at one's reflection in water, and why the Greeks
          regarded it as an omen of death if a man dreamed of seeing himself
          so reflected.<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href=

          feared that the water-spirits would drag the person's reflection
          (soul) under water, leaving him soulless to die. This was probably
          the origin of the classical story of the beautiful Narcissus, who
          pined and died in consequence of seeing his reflection in the
          water. The explanation that he died for love of his own fair image
          was probably devised later, after the old meaning of the story was
          forgotten. The same ancient belief lingers, in a faded form, in the
          English superstition that whoever sees a water-fairy must pine and
          die.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, we can
          now explain the widespread custom of covering up mirrors or turning
          them to the wall after a death has taken place in the house. It is
          feared that the soul, projected out of the person in the shape of
          his reflection in the mirror, may be carried off by the ghost of
          the departed, which is commonly supposed to linger about the house
          till the burial. The custom <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is thus exactly parallel to the Aru custom of
          not sleeping in a house after a death for fear that the soul,
          projected out of the body in a dream, may meet the ghost and be
          carried off by it.<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href=

          doubtless because they might reflect a person's image. The same

          also plain; in time of sickness, when the soul might take flight so
          easily, it is particularly dangerous to project the soul out of the
          body by means of the reflection in a mirror. The rule is therefore
          precisely parallel to the rule observed by some peoples of not
          allowing sick people to sleep;<a id="noteref_486" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> for
          in sleep the soul is projected out of the body, and there is always
          a risk that it may not return. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the

          perhaps on account of the mirror's supposed power of drawing out
          the soul in the reflection and so facilitating its capture.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As with shadows
          and reflections, so with portraits; they are often believed to
          contain the soul of the person portrayed. People who hold this
          belief are naturally loth to have their likenesses taken; for if
          the portrait is the soul, or at least a vital part of the person
          portrayed, whoever possesses the portrait will be able to exercise
          a fatal influence over the original of it. Thus the Canelos Indians
          of South America think that their soul is carried away in their
          picture. Two of them having been photographed were so alarmed that
          they came back next day on purpose to ask if it were really true
          that their souls had been taken away.<a id="noteref_488" name=

          themselves would be entirely at his mercy.<a id="noteref_489" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for the
          primitive conceptions of the soul and the dangers to which it is
          exposed. These conceptions are not limited to one people or
          country; with variations of detail they are found all over the
          world, and survive, as we have seen, in modern Europe. Beliefs so
          deep-seated and so widespread must necessarily have contributed to
          shape the mould in which the early kingship was cast. For if every
          individual was at such pains to save his own soul from the perils
          which threatened it from so many sides, how much more carefully
          must <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">he</span></em> have been guarded upon whose
          life hung the welfare and even the existence of the whole people,
          and whom therefore it was the common interest of all to preserve?
          Therefore we should expect to find the king's life protected by a
          system of precautions or safeguards still more numerous and minute
          than those which in primitive society every man adopts <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for the safety of his own soul. Now in
          point of fact the life of the early kings is regulated, as we have
          seen and shall see more fully presently, by a very exact code of
          rules. May we not then conjecture that these rules are the very
          safeguards which on <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">à
          priori</span></span> grounds we expect to find adopted for the
          protection of the king's life? An examination of the rules
          themselves confirms this conjecture. For from this it appears that
          some of the rules observed by the kings are identical with those
          observed by private persons out of regard for the safety of their
          souls; and even of those which seem peculiar to the king, many, if
          not all, are most readily explained on the hypothesis that they are
          nothing but safeguards or lifeguards of the king. I will now
          enumerate some of these royal rules or taboos, offering on each of
          them such comments and explanations as may serve to set the
          original intention of the rule in its proper light.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the object of
          the royal taboos is to isolate the king from all sources of danger,
          their general effect is to compel him to live in a state of
          seclusion, more or less complete, according to the number and
          stringency of the taboos he observes. Now of all sources of danger
          none are more dreaded by the savage than magic and witchcraft, and
          he suspects all strangers of practising these black arts. To guard
          against the baneful influence exerted voluntarily or involuntarily
          by strangers is therefore an elementary dictate of savage prudence.
          Hence before strangers are allowed to enter a district, or at least
          before they are permitted to mingle freely with the people of the
          district, certain ceremonies are often performed by the natives of
          the country for the purpose of disarming the strangers of their
          magical powers, of counteracting the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> baneful influence which is believed to
          emanate from them, or of disinfecting, so to speak, the tainted
          atmosphere by which they are supposed to be surrounded. Thus in the
          island of Nanumea (South Pacific) strangers from ships or from
          other islands were not allowed to communicate with the people until
          they all, or a few as representatives of the rest, had been taken
          to each of the four temples in the island, and prayers offered that
          the god would avert any disease or treachery which these strangers
          might have brought with them. Meat offerings were also laid upon
          the altars, accompanied by songs and dances in honour of the god.
          While these ceremonies were going on, all the people except the
          priests and their attendants kept out of sight.<a id="noteref_495"

          the sacrifice of animals (buffaloes or pigs) to the spirits of the
          land and water, in order to reconcile them to the presence of the

          children, the father or other member of the family takes the
          ornament which the children wear in their hair and hands it to the
          stranger, who holds it in his hands for a while and then gives it
          back to him. This is thought to protect the children from the evil

          Shepherd's Isle Captain Moresby had to be disenchanted before he
          was allowed to land his boat's crew. When he leaped ashore a
          devil-man seized his right hand and waved a bunch of palm leaves
          over the captain's head. Then <span class="tei tei-q">“he placed
          the leaves in my left hand, putting a small green twig into his
          mouth, still holding me fast, and then, as if with great effort,
          drew the twig from his mouth—this was extracting the evil

          between my teeth, and he went through the same process.”</span>
          Then the two raced round a couple of sticks fixed in the ground and
          bent to an angle at the top, which had leaves tied to it. After
          some more ceremonies the devil-man concluded by leaping to the
          level of Captain Moresby's shoulders (his hands resting on the
          captain's shoulders) several times, <span class="tei tei-q">“as if
          to show that he had conquered the devil, and was now trampling him

          delighting in mischief. One of the duties of the medicine chief is
          to exorcise these spirits. I have sometimes ridden into or through
          a camp where I was unknown or unexpected, to be confronted by a
          tall, half-naked savage, standing in the middle of the circle of
          lodges, and yelling in a sing-song, nasal tone, a string of
          unintelligible words.”</span><a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503"

          Crevaux was travelling in South America he entered a village of the
          Apalai Indians. A few moments after his arrival some of the Indians
          brought him a number of large black ants, of a species whose bite
          is painful, fastened on palm leaves. Then all the people of the
          village, without distinction of age or sex, presented themselves to
          him, and he had to sting them all with the ants on their faces,
          thighs, etc. Sometimes when he applied the ants too tenderly they
          called out <span class="tei tei-q">“More! more!”</span> and were
          not satisfied till their skin was thickly studded with tiny
          swellings like what might have been produced by whipping them
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a> The
          object of this ceremony is made plain by the custom observed in
          Amboina and Uliase of sprinkling sick people with pungent spices,
          such as ginger and cloves, chewed fine, in order by the prickling
          sensation to drive away the demon of disease which may be clinging
          to their persons.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href=

          a similar intention some of the natives of Borneo and Celebes
          sprinkle rice upon the head or body of a person supposed to be
          infested by dangerous spirits; a fowl is then brought, which, by
          picking up the rice from the person's head or body, removes along
          with it the spirit or ghost which is clinging like a burr to his
          skin. This is done, for example, to persons who have attended a
          funeral, and who may therefore be supposed to be infested by the
          ghost of the deceased.<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href=

          Similarly Basutos, who have carried a corpse to the grave, have
          their hands scratched with a knife from the tip of the thumb to the
          tip of the forefinger, and magic stuff is rubbed into the
          wound,<a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> for
          the purpose, no doubt, of removing the ghost which may be adhering
          to their skin. The people of Nias carefully scrub and scour the
          weapons and clothes which they buy, in order to efface all
          connection between the things and the persons from whom they bought
          them.<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> It is
          probable that the same dread of strangers, rather than any desire
          to do them honour, is the motive of certain ceremonies which are
          sometimes observed at their reception, but of which the intention
          is not directly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg

          stated. In Afghanistan and in some parts of Persia the traveller,
          before he enters a village, is frequently received with a sacrifice
          of animal life or food, or of fire and incense. The recent Afghan
          Boundary Mission, in passing by villages in Afghanistan, was often
          met with fire and incense.<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509"

          Sometimes a tray of lighted embers is thrown under the hoofs of the
          traveller's horse, with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“You are
          welcome.”</span><a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href=

          entering a village in Central Africa Emin Pasha was received with
          the sacrifice of two goats; their blood was sprinkled on the path
          and the chief stepped over the blood to greet Emin.<a id=

          Amongst the Eskimos of Cumberland Inlet, when a stranger arrives at
          an encampment, the sorcerer goes out to meet him. The stranger
          folds his arms and inclines his head to one side, so as to expose
          his cheek, upon which the sorcerer deals a terrible blow, sometimes
          felling him to the ground. Next the sorcerer in his turn presents
          his cheek and receives a buffet from the stranger. Then they kiss
          each other, the ceremony is over, and the stranger is hospitably
          received by all.<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href=

          Sometimes the dread of strangers and their magic is too great to
          allow of their reception on any terms. Thus when Speke arrived at a
          certain village the natives shut their doors against him,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“because they had never before seen a white
          man nor the tin boxes that the men were carrying: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Who knows,’</span> they said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘but that these very boxes are the plundering Watuta

          "Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> persuasion could
          avail with them, and the party had to proceed to the next
          village.”</span><a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fear thus
          entertained of alien visitors is often mutual. Entering a strange
          land, the savage feels that he is treading enchanted ground, and he
          takes steps to guard against the demons that haunt it and the
          magical arts of its inhabitants. Thus on going to a strange land
          the Maoris performed certain ceremonies to make it <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">noa</span></span> (common), lest it might have
          been previously <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a> When
          Baron Miklucho-Maclay was approaching a village on the Maclay Coast
          of New Guinea, one of the natives who accompanied him broke a
          branch from a tree and going aside whispered to it for a while;
          then going up to each member of the party, one after another, he
          spat something upon his back and gave him some blows with the
          branch. Lastly, he went into the forest and buried the branch under
          withered leaves in the thickest part of the jungle. This ceremony
          was believed to protect the party against all treachery and danger
          in the village they were approaching.<a id="noteref_515" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a> The
          idea probably was that the malignant influences were drawn off from
          the persons into the branch and buried with it in the depths of the
          forest. In Australia, when a strange tribe has been invited into a
          district and is approaching the encampment of the tribe which owns
          the land, <span class="tei tei-q">“the strangers carry lighted bark
          or burning sticks in their hands, for the purpose, they say, of
          clearing and purifying the air.”</span><a id="noteref_516" name=

          march in front of each, bearing lighted torches, which they flung

          thought that a man who has been on a journey may have contracted
          some magic evil from the strangers with whom he has been brought
          into contact. Hence on returning home, before he is readmitted to
          the society of his tribe and friends, he has to undergo certain
          purificatory ceremonies. Thus the Bechuanas <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cleanse or purify themselves after journeys by shaving
          their heads, etc., lest they should have contracted from strangers

          all his sins, to answer all questions that may be put to him, and
          to take certain vows. This ends the ceremony, and the strangers are

          death. A favourite dog having broken into the room where the king
          was dining, the king ordered it to be killed on the spot. Once the
          king's own son, a boy of twelve years old, inadvertently saw the
          king drink. Immediately the king ordered him to be finely
          apparelled and feasted, after which he commanded him to be cut in
          quarters, and carried about the city with a proclamation that he
          had seen the king drink. <span class="tei tei-q">“When the king has
          a mind to drink, he has a cup of wine brought; he that brings it
          has a bell in his hand, and as soon as he has delivered the cup to
          the king he turns his face from him and rings the bell, on which
          all present fall down with their faces to the ground, and continue
          so till the king has drank.... His eating is much in the same
          style, for which he has a house on purpose, where his victuals are
          set upon a bensa or table: which he goes to and shuts the door;
          when he has done, he knocks and comes out. So that none ever see

          Similarly no man may drink out of the same cup or glass with the

          Amongst the Alfoers of Celebes there is a priest called the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          to make the rice grow. His functions begin about a month before the
          rice is sown, and end after the crop is housed. During this time he
          has to observe certain taboos; amongst others he may not eat or
          drink with any one else, and he may drink out of no vessel but his
          own.<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that the Mikado's food was cooked <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          dishes; both pots and dishes were of common clay, in order that
          they might be broken or laid aside after they had been once used.
          They were generally broken, for it was believed that if any one
          else ate his food out of these sacred dishes his mouth and throat
          would become swollen and inflamed. The same ill effect was thought
          to be experienced by any one who should wear the Mikado's clothes
          without his leave; he would have swellings and pains all over his
          body.<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a> In
          the evil effects thus supposed to follow upon the use of the
          Mikado's vessels or clothes we see that other side of the divine
          king's or god-man's character to which attention has been already
          called. The divine person is a source of danger as well as of
          blessing; he must not only be guarded, he must also be guarded
          against. His sacred organism, so delicate that a touch may disorder
          it, is also electrically charged with a powerful spiritual force
          which may discharge itself with fatal effect on whatever comes in
          contact with it. Hence the isolation of the man-god is quite as
          necessary for the safety of others as for his own. His divinity is
          a fire, which, under proper restraints, confers endless blessings,
          but, if rashly touched or allowed to break bounds, burns and
          destroys what it touches. Hence the disastrous effects supposed to
          attend a breach of taboo; the offender has thrust his hand into the
          divine fire, which shrivels up and consumes him on the spot. To
          take an example from the taboo we are considering. It happened that
          a New Zealand chief of high rank and great sanctity had left the
          remains of his dinner by the wayside. A slave, a <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stout, hungry fellow, coming up after
          the chief had gone, saw the unfinished dinner, and ate it up
          without asking questions. Hardly had he finished when he was
          informed by a horror-stricken spectator that the food of which he
          had eaten was the chief's. <span class="tei tei-q">“I knew the
          unfortunate delinquent well. He was remarkable for courage, and had
          signalised himself in the wars of the tribe.... No sooner did he
          hear the fatal news than he was seized by the most extraordinary
          convulsions and cramp in the stomach, which never ceased till he
          died, about sundown the same day. He was a strong man, in the prime
          of life, and if any pakeha [European] freethinker should have said
          he was not killed by the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tapu</span></span> [taboo] of the chief, which
          had been communicated to the food by contact, he would have been
          listened to with feelings of contempt for his ignorance and
          inability to understand plain and direct evidence.”</span><a id=

          is not a solitary case. A Maori woman having eaten of some fruit,
          and being afterwards told that the fruit had being taken from a
          tabooed place, exclaimed that the spirit of the chief whose
          sanctity had been thus profaned would kill her. This was in the
          afternoon, and next day by twelve o'clock she was dead.<a id=

          light their pipes, they died of fright on learning to whom it had
          belonged. So too the garments of a high New Zealand chief will kill
          any one else who wears them. A chief was observed by a missionary
          to throw down a precipice a blanket which he found too heavy to
          carry. Being asked by the missionary why he did not leave it on a
          tree for the use of a future traveller, the chief replied that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it was the fear of its being taken by
          another which caused him to throw it where he did, for if it were
          worn, his tapu”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> his spiritual power
          communicated by contact to the blanket and through the blanket to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No wonder
          therefore that the savage should rank these human divinities
          amongst what he regards as the dangerous classes, and should impose
          exactly the same restraints upon the one as upon the other. For
          instance, those who have defiled themselves by touching a dead body
          are regarded by the Maoris as in a very dangerous state, and are
          sedulously shunned and isolated. But the taboos observed by and
          towards these defiled persons (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
          they may not touch food with their hands, and the vessels used by
          them may not be used by other people) are identical with those
          observed by and towards sacred chiefs.<a id="noteref_566" name=

          in general, the prohibition to use the dress, vessels, etc., of
          certain persons and the effects supposed to follow an infraction of
          the rule are exactly the same whether the persons to whom the
          things belong are sacred or what we might call unclean and
          polluted. As the garments which have been touched by a sacred chief
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name=

          handle them, so do the things which have been touched by a
          menstruous woman. An Australian blackfellow, who discovered that
          his wife had lain on his blanket at her menstrual period, killed

          Australian women at these times are forbidden under pain of death

          Amongst some of the Indians of North America also women at

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the rules
          of ceremonial purity observed by divine kings, chiefs, and priests,
          by homicides, women at child-birth, and so on, are in some respects
          alike. To us these different classes of persons appear to differ
          totally in character and condition; some of them we should call
          holy, others we might pronounce unclean and polluted. But the
          savage makes no such moral distinction between them; the
          conceptions of holiness and pollution are not yet differentiated in
          his mind. To him the common feature of all these persons is that
          they are dangerous and in danger, and the danger in which they
          stand and to which they expose others is what we should call
          spiritual or supernatural, that is, imaginary. The danger, however,
          is not less real because it is imaginary; imagination acts upon man
          as really as does gravitation, and may kill him as certainly as a
          dose of prussic acid. To seclude these persons from the rest of the
          world so that the dreaded spiritual danger shall neither reach
          them, nor spread from them, is the object of the taboos which they
          have to observe. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg

          These taboos act, so to say, as electrical insulators to preserve
          the spiritual force with which these persons are charged from

          superstitious objection to iron perhaps dates from that early time
          in the history of society when iron was still a novelty, and as
          such was viewed by many with suspicion and dislike. For everything
          new is apt to excite the awe and dread of the savage. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is a curious superstition,”</span> says a recent
          pioneer in Borneo, <span class="tei tei-q">“this of the Dusuns, to
          attribute anything—whether good or bad, lucky or unlucky—that
          happens to them to something novel which has arrived in their
          country. For instance, my living in Kindram has caused the
          intensely hot weather we have experienced of late.”</span><a id=

          first introduction of iron ploughshares into Poland having been

          them for the old wooden ones.<a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594"

          general dislike of innovation, which always makes itself strongly
          felt in the sphere of religion, is sufficient by itself to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name=
          "Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> account for the
          superstitious aversion to iron entertained by kings and priests and
          attributed by them to the gods; possibly this aversion may have
          been intensified in places by some such accidental cause as the
          series of bad seasons which cast discredit on iron ploughshares in
          Poland. But the disfavour in which iron is held by the gods and
          their ministers has another side. The very fact that iron is deemed
          obnoxious to spirits furnishes men with a weapon which may be
          turned against the spirits when occasion serves. As their dislike
          of iron is supposed to be so great that they will not approach
          persons and things protected by the obnoxious metal, iron may
          obviously be employed as a charm for banning ghosts and other
          dangerous spirits. And it often is so used. Thus when Scotch
          fishermen were at sea, and one of them happened to take the name of
          God in vain, the first man who heard him called out <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cauld airn,”</span> at which every man of the crew

          near, lest they should wound it. Thus after a death the Roumanians

          old Prussians and Lithuanians used to prepare a meal, to which,

          these meals they sat silent round the table and used no knives, and
          the women who served up the food were also without knives. If any
          morsels fell from the table they were left lying there for the
          lonely souls that had no living relations or friends to feed them.
          When the meal was over the priest took a broom and swept the souls

          ghost. They are shut up in the house, touch no raw flesh, and chew
          beetel over which an incantation has been uttered by the exorcist.
          After this the ghost of the slaughtered man goes away to the

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a> The
          taboo is probably based on the common belief that the soul or
          spirit of the animal is in the blood. As tabooed persons are
          believed to be in a perilous state—for example, the relations of
          the slain man are liable to the attacks of his indignant ghost—it
          is especially necessary to isolate them from contact with spirits;
          hence the prohibition to touch raw meat. But as usual the taboo is
          only the special enforcement in particular circumstances of a
          general rule; in other words, its observance is particularly
          enjoined in circumstances which are supposed especially to call for
          its application, but apart from such special circumstances the
          prohibition is also observed, though less strictly, as an ordinary
          rule of life. Thus some of the Esthonians will not taste blood
          because they believe that it contains the animal's soul, which

          explanation of the reluctance to shed blood on the ground is
          probably to be found in the belief that the soul is in the blood,
          and that therefore any ground on which it may fall necessarily
          becomes taboo or sacred. In New Zealand anything upon which even a
          drop of a high chief's blood chances to fall becomes taboo or
          sacred to him. For instance, a party of natives having come to
          visit a chief in a fine new canoe, the chief got into it, but in
          doing so a splinter entered his foot, and the blood trickled on the
          canoe, which at once became sacred to him. The owner jumped out,
          dragged the canoe ashore opposite the chief's house, and left it
          there. Again, a chief in entering a missionary's house knocked his
          head against a beam, and the blood flowed. The natives said that in
          former times the house would have belonged to the chief.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">637</span></span></a> As
          usually happens with taboos of universal application, the
          prohibition to spill the blood of a tribesman on the ground applies
          with peculiar stringency to chiefs and kings, and is observed in
          their case long after it has ceased to be observed in the case of
          others.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that the Flamen Dialis was not allowed to walk under a trellised
          vine.<a id="noteref_638" name="noteref_638" href=
          "#note_638"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a> The
          reason for this prohibition was perhaps as follows. It has been
          shown that plants are considered as animate beings which bleed when
          cut, the red juice which exudes from some plants being regarded as
          the blood of the plant.<a id="noteref_639" name="noteref_639" href=
          "#note_639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">639</span></span></a> The
          juice of the grape is therefore naturally conceived as the blood of
          the vine.<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640" href=
          "#note_640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a> And
          since, as we have just <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg
          184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          seen, the soul is often believed to be in the blood, the juice of
          the grape is regarded as the soul, or as containing the soul, of
          the vine. This belief is strengthened by the intoxicating effects
          of wine. For, according to primitive notions, all abnormal mental
          states, such as intoxication or madness, are caused by the entrance
          of a spirit into the person; such mental states, in other words,
          are regarded as forms of possession or inspiration. Wine,
          therefore, is considered on two distinct grounds as a spirit or
          containing a spirit; first because, as a red juice, it is
          identified with the blood of the plant, and second because it
          intoxicates or inspires. Therefore if the Flamen Dialis had walked
          under a trellised vine, the spirit of the vine, embodied in the
          clusters of grapes, would have been immediately over his head and
          might have touched it, which for a person like him in a state of
          permanent taboo<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href=
          "#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a> would
          have been highly dangerous. This interpretation of the prohibition
          will be made probable if we can show, first, that wine has been
          actually viewed by some peoples as blood and intoxication as
          inspiration produced by drinking the blood; and, second, that it is
          often considered dangerous, especially for tabooed persons, to have
          either blood or a living person over their heads.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
          the first point, we are informed by Plutarch that of old the
          Egyptian kings neither drank wine nor offered it in libations to
          the gods, because they held it to be the blood of beings who had
          once fought against the gods, the vine having sprung from their
          rotting bodies; and the frenzy of intoxication was explained by the
          supposition that the drunken man was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> filled with the blood of the enemies of the
          gods.<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href=
          "#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Aztecs regarded <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pulque</span></span> or the wine of the
          country as bad, on account of the wild deeds which men did under
          its influence. But these wild deeds were believed to be the acts,
          not of the drunken man, but of the wine-god by whom he was
          possessed and inspired; and so seriously was this theory of
          inspiration held that if any one spoke ill of or insulted a tipsy
          man, he was liable to be punished for disrespect to the wine-god
          incarnate in his votary. Hence, says Sahagun, it was believed, not
          without ground, that the Indians intoxicated themselves on purpose
          to commit with impunity crimes for which they would certainly have
          been punished if they had committed them sober.<a id="noteref_643"
          name="noteref_643" href="#note_643"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> Thus
          it appears that on the primitive view intoxication or the
          inspiration produced by wine is exactly parallel to the inspiration
          produced by drinking the blood of animals.<a id="noteref_644" name=
          "noteref_644" href="#note_644"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a> The
          soul or life is in the blood, and wine is the blood of the vine.
          Hence whoever drinks the blood of an animal is inspired with the
          soul of the animal or of the god, who, as we have seen,<a id=
          "noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href="#note_645"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">645</span></span></a> is
          often supposed to enter into the animal before it is slain; and
          whoever drinks wine drinks the blood, and so receives into himself
          the soul or spirit, of the god of the vine.</p>

          The reason they give is that a woman may <span class="tei tei-pb"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Probably in all
          such cases the rule is based on a fear of being brought into
          contact with blood, especially the blood of women. From a like fear
          a Maori will never lean his back against the wall of a native

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          reason for not passing under dangerous objects, like a vine or
          women's blood, is a fear that they may come in contact with the
          head; for among primitive people the head is peculiarly sacred. The
          special sanctity attributed to it is sometimes explained by a
          belief that it is the seat of a spirit which is very sensitive to
          injury or disrespect. Thus the Karens suppose that a being called
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tso</span></span> resides in the upper part of
          the head, and while it retains its seat no harm can befall the
          person from the efforts of the seven <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kelahs</span></span>, or personified passions.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But if the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tso</span></span>
          becomes heedless or weak certain evil to the person is the result.
          Hence the head is carefully attended to, and all possible pains are
          taken to provide such dress and attire as will be pleasing to the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tso</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_657"

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a> The
          Siamese think that a spirit called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Khuan</span></span>, or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Chom
          Kuan</span></span>, dwells in the human head, of which it is the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name=
          "Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> guardian spirit. The
          spirit must be carefully protected from injury of every kind; hence
          the act of shaving or cutting the hair is accompanied with many
          ceremonies. The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Khuan</span></span> is very sensitive on
          points of honour, and would feel mortally insulted if the head in
          which he resides were touched by the hand of a stranger. When Dr.
          Bastian, in conversation with a brother of the king of Siam, raised
          his hand to touch the prince's skull in order to illustrate some
          medical remarks he was making, a sullen and threatening murmur
          bursting from the lips of the crouching courtiers warned him of the
          breach of etiquette he had committed, for in Siam there is no
          greater insult to a man of rank than to touch his head. If a
          Siamese touch the head of another with his foot, both of them must
          build chapels to the earth-spirit to avert the omen. Nor does the
          guardian spirit of the head like to have the hair washed too often;
          it might injure or incommode him. It was a grand solemnity when the
          king of Burmah's head was washed with water taken from the middle
          of the river. Whenever the native professor, from whom Dr. Bastian
          took lessons in Burmese at Mandalay, had his head washed, which
          took place as a rule once a month, he was generally absent for
          three days together, that time being consumed in preparing for, and
          recovering from, the operation of head-washing. Dr. Bastian's
          custom of washing his head daily gave rise to much remark.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          Burmese think it an indignity to have any one, especially a woman,
          over their heads, and for this reason Burmese houses have never
          more than one story. The houses are raised on posts above the
          ground, and whenever anything fell through the floor <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Dr. Bastian had always difficulty in
          persuading a servant to fetch it from under the house. In Rangoon a
          priest, summoned to the bedside of a sick man, climbed up a ladder
          and got in at the window rather than ascend the staircase, to reach
          which he must have passed under a gallery. A pious Burman of
          Rangoon, finding some images of Buddha in a ship's cabin, offered a
          high price for them, that they might not be degraded by sailors
          walking over them on the deck.<a id="noteref_659" name=

          Similarily the Cambodians esteem it a grave offence to touch a
          man's head; some of them will not enter a place where anything
          whatever is suspended over their heads; and the meanest Cambodian
          would never consent to live under an inhabited room. Hence the
          houses are built of one story only; and even the Government
          respects the prejudice by never placing a prisoner in the stocks
          under the floor of a house, though the houses are raised high above
          the ground.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href=

          same superstition exists amongst the Malays; for an early traveller
          reports that in Java people <span class="tei tei-q">“wear nothing
          on their heads, and say that nothing must be on their heads ... and
          if any person were to put his hand upon their head they would kill
          him; and they do not build houses with storeys, in order that they
          may not walk over each other's heads.”</span><a id="noteref_661"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a> It is
          also found in full force throughout Polynesia. Thus of Gattanewa, a
          Marquesan chief, it is said that <span class="tei tei-q">“to touch
          the top of his head, or any thing which had been on his head was
          sacrilege. To pass over his head <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> was an indignity never to be forgotten.
          Gattanewa, nay, all his family, scorned to pass a gateway which is
          ever closed, or a house with a door; all must be as open and free
          as their unrestrained manners. He would pass under nothing that had
          been raised by the hand of man, if there was a possibility of
          getting round or over it. Often have I seen him walk the whole
          length of our barrier, in preference to passing between our
          water-casks; and at the risk of his life scramble over the loose
          stones of a wall, rather than go through the gateway.”</span><a id=

          Marquesan women have been known to refuse to go on the decks of

          it was not the Marquesan chiefs only whose heads were sacred; the

          whatever touched the child's head, while it was in this state,
          became sacred and was deposited in a consecrated place railed in
          for the purpose at the child's house. If a branch of a tree touched
          the child's head, the tree was cut down; and if in its fall it
          injured another tree so as to penetrate the bark, that tree also
          was cut down as unclean and unfit for use. After the rites were
          performed, these special taboos ceased; but the head of a Tahitian
          was always sacred, he never carried anything on it, and to touch it
          was an offence.<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href=

          lads during the year of their initiation into manhood, and young
          braves on their first war-path, are forbidden to scratch their
          heads with their fingers, and are provided with a stick for the

          a crime for a sacred person in New Zealand to leave his comb, or
          anything else which has touched his head, in a place where food has
          been cooked, or to suffer another person to drink out of any vessel
          which has touched his lips. Hence when a chief wishes to drink he
          never puts his lips to the vessel, but holds his hands close to his
          mouth so as to form a hollow, into which water is poured by another
          person, and thence is allowed to flow into his mouth. If a light is
          needed for his pipe, the burning ember taken from the fire must be
          thrown away as soon as it is used; for the pipe becomes sacred
          because it has touched his mouth; the coal becomes sacred because
          it has touched the pipe; and if a particle of the sacred cinder
          were replaced on the common fire, the fire would also become sacred
          and could no longer be used for cooking.<a id="noteref_672" name=

          193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the animal; just as the reason why the Flamen Dialis might not
          walk under a vine was the fear of bringing his sacred head into
          contact with the spirit of the vine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the head
          was considered so sacred that it might not even be touched without
          grave offence, it is obvious that the cutting of the hair must have
          been a delicate and difficult operation. The difficulties and
          dangers which, on the primitive view, beset the operation are of
          two kinds. There is first the danger of disturbing the spirit of
          the head, which may be injured in the process and may revenge
          itself upon the person who molests him. Secondly, there is the
          difficulty of disposing of the shorn locks. For the savage believes
          that the sympathetic connection which exists between himself and
          every part of his body continues to exist even after the physical
          connection has been severed, and that therefore he will suffer from
          any harm that may befall the severed parts of his body, such as the
          clippings of his hair or the parings of his nails. Accordingly he
          takes care that these severed portions of himself shall not be left
          in places where they might either be exposed to accidental injury
          or fall into the hands of malicious persons who might work magic on
          them to his detriment or death. Such dangers are common to all, but
          sacred persons have more to fear from them than ordinary people, so
          the precautions taken by them are proportionately stringent. The
          simplest way of evading the danger is of course not to cut the hair
          at all; and this is the expedient adopted where the danger is
          thought to be more than usually great. The Frankish kings were not
          allowed to cut their hair.<a id="noteref_675" name="noteref_675"

          strangers amongst whom he sojourns; if they got possession of his

          Again, men who have taken a vow of vengeance sometimes keep their
          hair unshorn till they have fulfilled their vow. Thus of the
          Marquesans we are told that <span class="tei tei-q">“occasionally
          they have their head entirely shaved, except one lock on the crown,
          which is worn loose or put up in a knot. But the latter mode of
          wearing the hair is only adopted by them when they have a solemn
          vow, as to revenge the death of some near relation, etc. In such
          case the lock is never cut off until they have fulfilled their
          promise.”</span><a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href=

          Possibly in this case there was a special objection to touching the
          tabooed man's head with iron. The Roman priests, as we have seen,
          were shorn with bronze knives. The same feeling probably gave rise
          to the European rule that a child's nails should not be cut during
          the first year, but that if it is absolutely necessary to shorten
          them they should be bitten off by the mother or nurse.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before leaving
          this subject, on which I have perhaps dwelt too long, it may be
          well to call attention to the motive assigned for cutting a young

          that island the first hair is regarded as a danger to the child,
          and its removal is intended to avert the danger. The reason of this
          may be that as a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg

          young child is almost universally supposed to be in a tabooed or
          dangerous state, it is necessary, in removing the taboo, to destroy
          the separable parts of the child's body on the ground that they are
          infected, so to say, by the virus of the taboo and as such are
          dangerous. The cutting of the child's hair would thus be exactly
          parallel to the destruction of the vessels which have been used by
          a tabooed person.<a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a> This
          view is borne out by a practice, observed by some Australians, of
          burning off part of a woman's hair after childbirth as well as
          burning every vessel which has been used by her during her
          seclusion.<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href=

          the burning of the woman's hair seems plainly intended to serve the
          same purpose as the burning of the vessels used by her; and as the
          vessels are burned because they are believed to be tainted with a
          dangerous infection, so, we must suppose, is also the hair. We can,
          therefore, understand the importance attached by many peoples to
          the first cutting of a child's hair and the elaborate ceremonies by
          which the operation is accompanied.<a id="noteref_746" name=

          ceremonies before he is allowed to mingle freely with his own

          hypothesis the polling of the hair is simply one of these
          purificatory or disinfectant ceremonies. The cutting of the hair
          after a vow may have the same meaning. It is a way of ridding the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name=

          (for all these are only different expressions for the same
          primitive conception) under which he laboured during the
          continuance of the vow. Similarly at some Hindu places of
          pilgrimage on the banks of rivers men who have committed great
          crimes or are troubled by uneasy consciences have every hair shaved
          off by professional barbers before they plunge into the sacred

          another he considers would prove dangerous or fatal to the eater.
          Examples of such abstinence are too familiar and far too numerous
          to quote. But if the ordinary man is thus deterred by superstitious
          fear from partaking of various foods, the restraints of this kind
          which are laid upon sacred or tabooed persons, such as kings and
          priests, are still more numerous and stringent. We have already

          namely, the conservation of the tribe and the individual.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be easy
          to extend the list of royal and priestly taboos, but the above may
          suffice as specimens. To conclude this part of our subject it only
          remains to state summarily the general conclusions to which our
          inquiries have thus far conducted us. We have seen that in savage
          or barbarous society there are often found men to whom the
          superstition of their fellows ascribes a controlling influence over
          the general course of nature. Such men are accordingly adored and
          treated as gods. Whether these human divinities <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> also hold temporal sway over the lives
          and fortunes of their fellows, or whether their functions are
          purely spiritual and supernatural, in other words, whether they are
          kings as well as gods or only the latter, is a distinction which
          hardly concerns us here. Their supposed divinity is the essential
          fact with which we have to deal. In virtue of it they are a pledge
          and guarantee to their worshippers of the continuance and orderly
          succession of those physical phenomena upon which mankind depends
          for subsistence. Naturally, therefore, the life and health of such
          a god-man are matters of anxious concern to the people whose
          welfare and even existence are bound up with his; naturally he is
          constrained by them to conform to such rules as the wit of early
          man has devised for averting the ills to which flesh is heir,
          including the last ill, death. These rules, as an examination of
          them has shown, are nothing but the maxims with which, on the
          primitive view, every man of common prudence must comply if he
          would live long in the land. But while in the case of ordinary men
          the observance of the rules is left to the choice of the
          individual, in the case of the god-man it is enforced under penalty
          of dismissal from his high station, or even of death. For his
          worshippers have far too great a stake in his life to allow him to
          play fast and loose with it. Therefore all the quaint
          superstitions, the old-world maxims, the venerable saws which the
          ingenuity of savage philosophers elaborated long ago, and which old
          women at chimney corners still impart as treasures of great price
          to their descendants gathered round the cottage fire on winter
          evenings—all these antique fancies clustered, all these cobwebs of
          the brain were spun about the path of the old king, the human god,
          who, immeshed in them like <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> a fly in the toils of a spider, could hardly
          stir a limb for the threads of custom, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“light as air but strong as links of iron,”</span> that
          crossing and recrossing each other in an endless maze bound him
          fast within a network of observances from which death or deposition
          alone could release him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To students of
          the past the life of the old kings and priests thus teems with
          instruction. In it was summed up all that passed for wisdom when
          the world was young. It was the perfect pattern after which every
          man strove to shape his life; a faultless model constructed with
          rigorous accuracy upon the lines laid down by a barbarous
          philosophy. Crude and false as that philosophy may seem to us, it
          would be unjust to deny it the merit of logical consistency.
          Starting from a conception of the vital principle as a tiny being
          or soul existing in, but distinct and separable from, the living
          being, it deduces for the practical guidance of life a system of
          rules which in general hangs well together and forms a fairly
          complete and harmonious whole. The flaw—and it is a fatal one—of
          the system lies not in its reasoning, but in its premises; in its
          conception of the nature of life, not in any irrelevancy of the
          conclusions which it draws from that conception. But to stigmatise
          these premises as ridiculous because we can easily detect their
          falseness, would be ungrateful as well as unphilosophical. We stand
          upon the foundation reared by the generations that have gone
          before, and we can but dimly realise the painful and prolonged
          efforts which it has cost humanity to struggle up to the point, no
          very exalted one after all, which we have reached. Our gratitude is
          due to the nameless and forgotten toilers, whose patient thought
          and active exertions have largely made <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> us what we are. The amount of new knowledge
          which one age, certainly which one man, can add to the common store
          is small, and it argues stupidity or dishonesty, besides
          ingratitude, to ignore the heap while vaunting the few grains which
          it may have been our privilege to add to it. There is indeed little
          danger at present of undervaluing the contributions which modern
          times and even classical antiquity have made to the general
          advancement of our race. But when we pass these limits, the case is
          different. Contempt and ridicule or abhorrence and denunciation are
          too often the only recognition vouchsafed to the savage and his
          ways. Yet of the benefactors whom we are bound thankfully to
          commemorate, many, perhaps most, were savages. For when all is said
          and done our resemblances to the savage are still far more numerous
          than our differences from him; and what we have in common with him,
          and deliberately retain as true and useful, we owe to our savage
          forefathers who slowly acquired by experience and transmitted to us
          by inheritance those seemingly fundamental ideas which we are apt
          to regard as original and intuitive. We are like heirs to a fortune
          which has been handed down for so many ages that the memory of
          those who built it up is lost, and its possessors for the time
          being regard it as having been an original and unalterable
          possession of their race since the beginning of the world. But
          reflection and inquiry should satisfy us that to our predecessors
          we are indebted for much of what we thought most our own, and that
          their errors were not wilful extravagances or the ravings of
          insanity, but simply hypotheses, justifiable as such at the time
          when they were propounded, but which a fuller experience has proved
          to be inadequate. It is only by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> successive testing of hypotheses and
          rejection of the false that truth is at last elicited. After all,
          what we call truth is only the hypothesis which is found to work
          best. Therefore in reviewing the opinions and practices of ruder
          ages and races we shall do well to look with leniency upon their
          errors as inevitable slips made in the search for truth, and to
          give them the benefit of that indulgence which we may one day stand
          in need of ourselves: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the great
          invisible gods are thus supposed to die, it is not to be expected
          that a god who dwells in the flesh and blood of a man should escape
          the same fate. Now primitive peoples, as we have seen, sometimes
          believe that their safety and even that of the world is bound up
          with the life of one of these god-men or human incarnations of the
          divinity. Naturally, therefore, they take the utmost care of his
          life, out of a regard for their own. But no amount of care and
          precaution will prevent the man-god from growing old and feeble and
          at last dying. His worshippers have <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to lay their account with this sad necessity
          and to meet it as best they can. The danger is a formidable one;
          for if the course of nature is dependent on the man-god's life,
          what catastrophes may not be expected from the gradual enfeeblement
          of his powers and their final extinction in death? There is only
          one way of averting these dangers. The man-god must be killed as
          soon as he shows symptoms that his powers are beginning to fail,
          and his soul must be transferred to a vigorous successor before it
          has been seriously impaired by the threatened decay. The advantages
          of thus putting the man-god to death instead of allowing him to die
          of old age and disease are, to the savage, obvious enough. For if
          the man-god dies what we call a natural death, it means, according
          to the savage, that his soul has either voluntarily departed from
          his body and refuses to return, or more commonly that it has been
          extracted or at least detained in its wanderings by a demon or
          sorcerer.<a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href=
          "#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a> In
          any of these cases the soul of the man-god is lost to his
          worshippers; and with it their prosperity is gone and their very
          existence endangered. Even if they could arrange to catch the soul
          of the dying god as it left his lips or his nostrils and so
          transfer it to a successor, this would not effect their purpose;
          for, thus dying of disease, his soul would necessarily leave his
          body in the last stage of weakness and exhaustion, and as such it
          would continue to drag out a feeble existence in the body to which
          it might be transferred. Whereas by killing him his worshippers
          could, in the first place, make sure of catching his soul as it
          escaped and transferring it to a suitable successor; and, in the
          second place, by killing him before his natural force <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was abated, they would secure that the
          world should not fall into decay with the decay of the man-god.
          Every purpose, therefore, was answered, and all dangers averted by
          thus killing the man-god and transferring his soul, while yet at
          its prime, to a vigorous successor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          reasons for preferring a violent death to the slow death of old age
          or disease are obviously as applicable to common men as to the
          man-god. Thus the Mangaians think that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          spirits of those who die a natural death are excessively feeble and
          weak, as their bodies were at dissolution; whereas the spirits of
          those who are slain in battle are strong and vigorous, their bodies
          not having been reduced by disease.”</span><a id="noteref_765"
          name="noteref_765" href="#note_765"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a>
          Hence, men sometimes prefer to kill themselves or to be killed
          before they grow feeble, in order that in the future life their
          souls may start fresh and vigorous as they left their bodies,
          instead of decrepit and worn out with age and disease. Thus in
          Fiji, <span class="tei tei-q">“self-immolation is by no means rare,
          and they believe that as they leave this life, so they will remain
          ever after. This forms a powerful motive to escape from
          decrepitude, or from a crippled condition, by a voluntary
          death.”</span><a id="noteref_766" name="noteref_766" href=
          "#note_766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a> Or,
          as another observer of the Fijians puts it more fully, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the custom of voluntary suicide on the part of the old
          men, which is among their most extraordinary usages, is also
          connected with their superstitions respecting a future life. They
          believe that persons enter upon the delights of their elysium with
          the same faculties, mental and physical, that they possess at the
          hour of death, in short, that the spiritual life commences where
          the corporeal existence terminates. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> With these views, it is natural that they
          should desire to pass through this change before their mental and
          bodily powers are so enfeebled by age as to deprive them of their
          capacity for enjoyment. To this motive must be added the contempt
          which attaches to physical weakness among a nation of warriors, and
          the wrongs and insults which await those who are no longer able to
          protect themselves. When therefore a man finds his strength
          declining with the advance of age, and feels that he will soon be
          unequal to discharge the duties of this life, and to partake in the
          pleasures of that which is to come, he calls together his
          relations, and tells them that he is now worn out and useless, that
          he sees they are all ashamed of him, and that he has determined to
          be buried.”</span> So on a day appointed they meet and bury him
          alive.<a id="noteref_767" name="noteref_767" href=

          his power and merit, would immediately be annihilated. Accordingly
          when he fell ill and seemed likely to die, the man who was destined
          to be his successor entered the pontiff's house with a rope or a
          club and strangled or clubbed him to death.<a id="noteref_770"

          Ethiopian kings of Meroe were worshipped as gods; but whenever the
          priests chose, they sent a messenger to the king, ordering him to
          die, and alleging an oracle of the gods as their authority for the
          command. This command the kings always obeyed down to the reign of
          Ergamenes, a contemporary of Ptolemy II, King of Egypt. Having
          received a Greek education which emancipated him from the
          superstitions of his countrymen, Ergamenes ventured to disregard
          the command of the priests, and, entering the Golden Temple with a

          as soon as the king falls seriously ill or begins to break up from
          age, he shall be killed by his own wives; for, according to an old
          prophecy, the throne will pass away from the dynasty in the event
          of the king dying a natural death.<a id="noteref_772" name=

          seems to have been a Zulu custom to put the king to death as soon
          as he began to have wrinkles or gray hairs. At least this seems
          implied in the following <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg
          219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          passage, written by one who resided for some time at the court of
          the notorious Zulu tyrant Chaka, in the early part of this century:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The extraordinary violence of the king's
          rage with me was mainly occasioned by that absurd nostrum, the hair
          oil, with the notion of which Mr. Farewell had impressed him as
          being a specific for removing all indications of age. From the
          first moment of his having heard that such a preparation was
          attainable, he evinced a solicitude to procure it, and on every
          occasion never forgot to remind us of his anxiety respecting it;
          more especially on our departure on the mission his injunctions
          were particularly directed to this object. It will be seen that it
          is one of the barbarous customs of the Zoolas in their choice or
          election of their kings that he must neither have wrinkles nor gray
          hairs, as they are both distinguishing marks of disqualification
          for becoming a monarch of a warlike people. It is also equally
          indispensable that their king should never exhibit those proofs of
          having become unfit and incompetent to reign; it is therefore
          important that they should conceal these indications so long as
          they possibly can. Chaka had become greatly apprehensive of the
          approach of gray hairs; which would at once be the signal for him
          to prepare to make his exit from this sublunary world, it being
          always followed by the death of the monarch.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          putting kings to death as soon as they suffered from any personal
          defect prevailed two centuries ago in the Kafir kingdoms of Sofala,
          to the north of the present Zululand. These kings of Sofala, as we
          have seen,<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href=
          "#note_775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          regarded as gods by their people, being entreated to give rain or
          sunshine, according as each might <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> be wanted. Nevertheless a slight bodily
          blemish, such as the loss of a tooth, was considered a sufficient
          cause for putting one of these god-men to death, as we learn from
          the following passage of an old historian. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Contiguous to the domains of the Quiteva [the king of
          the country bordering on the river Sofala], are those of another
          prince called Sedanda. This prince becoming afflicted with leprosy,
          resolved on following implicitly the laws of the country, and
          poisoning himself, conceiving his malady to be incurable, or at
          least that it would render him so loathsome in the eyes of his
          people that they would with difficulty recognise him. In
          consequence he nominated his successor, holding as his opinion that
          sovereigns who should serve in all things as an example to their
          people ought to have no defect whatever, even in their persons;
          that when any defects may chance to befall them they cease to be
          worthy of life and of governing their dominions; and preferring
          death in compliance with this law to life, with the reproach of
          having been its violator. But this law was not observed with equal
          scrupulosity by one of the Quitevas, who, having lost a tooth and
          feeling no disposition to follow the practice of his predecessors,
          published to the people that he had lost a front tooth, in order
          that when they might behold, they yet might be able to recognise
          him; declaring at the same time that he was resolved on living and
          reigning as long as he could, esteeming his existence requisite for
          the welfare of his subjects. He at the same time loudly condemned
          the practice of his predecessors, whom he taxed with imprudence,
          nay, even with madness, for having condemned themselves to death
          for casual accidents to their persons, confessing plainly that it
          would be with much regret, even when the course of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nature should bring him to his end,
          that he should submit to die. He observed, moreover, that no
          reasonable being, much less a monarch, ought to anticipate the
          scythe of time; and, abrogating this mortal law, he ordained that
          all his successors, if sane, should follow the precedent he gave,
          and the new law established by him.”</span><a id="noteref_776"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This King of
          Sofala was, therefore, a bold reformer like Ergamenes, King of
          Ethiopia. We may conjecture that the ground for putting the
          Ethiopian kings to death was, as in the case of the Zulu and Sofala
          kings, the appearance on their person of any bodily defect or sign
          of decay; and that the oracle which the priests alleged as the
          authority for the royal execution was to the effect that great
          calamities would result from the reign of a king who had any
          blemish on his body; just as an oracle warned Sparta against a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lame reign,”</span> that is, the reign of

          conjecture is confirmed by the fact that the kings of Ethiopia were
          chosen for their size, strength, and beauty long before the custom
          of killing them was abolished.<a id="noteref_778" name=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with the other African examples before
          us, that any bodily defect or symptom of old age appearing on the
          person of the Ethiopian monarch was the signal for his execution.
          At a later time it is recorded that if the King of Ethiopia became
          maimed in any part of his body all his courtiers had to suffer the
          same mutilation.<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href=

          this rule may perhaps have been instituted at the time when the
          custom of killing the king for any personal defect was abolished;
          instead of compelling the king to die because, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>,
          he had lost a tooth, all his subjects would be obliged to lose a
          tooth, and thus the invidious superiority of the subjects over the
          king would be cancelled. A rule of this sort is still observed in
          the same region at the court of the Sultans of Darfur. When the
          Sultan coughs, every one makes the sound <span class=

          like the cry of the jeko; when he falls off his horse, all his
          followers must fall off likewise; if any one of them remains in the
          saddle, no matter how high his rank, he is laid on the ground and

          to return to the death of the divine man. The old Prussians
          acknowledged as their supreme lord a ruler who governed them in the
          name of the gods, and was known as God's Mouth (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kirwaido</span></span>). When he felt himself
          weak and ill, if he wished to leave a good name behind him, he had
          a great heap made of thorn-bushes and straw, on which he mounted
          and delivered a long sermon to the people, exhorting them to serve
          the gods and promising to go to the gods and speak for the people.
          Then he took some of the perpetual fire which burned in front of
          the holy oak-tree, and lighting the pile with it burned himself to
          death.<a id="noteref_784" name="noteref_784" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the cases
          hitherto described, the divine king or priest is suffered by his
          people to retain office until some outward defect, some visible
          symptom of failing health or advancing age warns them that he is no
          longer equal to the discharge of his divine duties; but not until
          such symptoms have made their appearance is he put to death. Some
          peoples, however, appear to have thought it unsafe to wait for even
          the slightest symptom of decay and have preferred to kill the king
          while he was still in the full vigour of life. Accordingly, they
          have fixed a term beyond which he might not reign, and at the close
          of which he must die, the term fixed upon being short enough to
          exclude the probability of his degenerating physically in the
          interval. In some parts of Southern India the period fixed was
          twelve years. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg

          Thus, according to an old traveller, in the province of Quilacare
          <span class="tei tei-q">“There is a Gentile house of prayer, in
          which there is an idol which they hold in great account, and every
          twelve years they celebrate a great feast to it, whither all the
          Gentiles go as to a jubilee. This temple possesses many lands and
          much revenue; it is a very great affair. This province has a king
          over it; who has not more than twelve years to reign from jubilee
          to jubilee. His manner of living is in this wise, that is to say,
          when the twelve years are completed, on the day of this feast there
          assemble together innumerable people, and much money is spent in
          giving food to Bramans. The king has a wooden scaffolding made,
          spread over with silken hangings; and on that day he goes to bathe
          at a tank with great ceremonies and sound of music, after that he
          comes to the idol and prays to it, and mounts on to the
          scaffolding, and there before all the people he takes some very
          sharp knives and begins to cut off his nose, and then his ears and
          his lips and all his members and as much flesh of himself as he
          can; and he throws it away very hurriedly until so much of his
          blood is spilled that he begins to faint, and then he cuts his
          throat himself. And he performs this sacrifice to the idol; and
          whoever desires to reign other twelve years, and undertake this
          martyrdom for love of the idol, has to be present looking on at
          this; and from that place they raise him up as king.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Formerly the
          Samorin or King of Calicut, on the Malabar coast, had also to cut
          his throat in public at the end of a twelve years' reign. But
          towards the end of the seventeenth century the rule had been
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“A new custom is followed by the modern
          Samorins, that jubilee is proclaimed throughout his dominions, at
          the end of twelve years, and a tent is pitched for him in a
          spacious plain, and a great feast is celebrated for ten or twelve
          days, with mirth and jollity, guns firing night and day, so at the
          end of the feast any four of the guests that have a mind to gain a
          crown by a desperate action, in fighting their way through 30 or
          40,000 of his guards, and kill the Samorin in his tent, he that
          kills him succeeds him in his empire. In anno 1695, one those
          jubilees happened, and the tent pitched near Pennany, a sea-port of
          his, about fifteen leagues to the southward of Calicut. There were
          but three men that would venture on that desperate action, who fell
          in, with sword and target among the guard, and, after they had
          killed and wounded many were themselves killed. One of the
          desperados had a nephew of fifteen or sixteen years of age, that
          kept close by his uncle in the attack on the guards, and, when he
          saw him fall, the youth got through the guards into the tent, and
          made a stroke at his Majesty's head, and had certainly despatched
          him, if a large brass lamp which was burning over his head, had not
          marred the blow; but, before he could make another he was killed by
          the guards; and, I believe, the same Samorin reigns yet. I chanced
          to come that time along the coast and heard the guns for two or
          three days and nights successively.”</span><a id="noteref_786"

          it appears that the people could not trust the king to remain in
          full bodily and mental vigour for more than a year; hence at the
          end of a year's reign he was put to death, and a new king

          Babylon a festival called the Sacaea. It began on the 16th day of
          the month Lous, and lasted for five days. During these five days
          masters and servants changed places, the servants giving orders and
          the masters obeying them. A prisoner condemned to death was dressed
          in the king's robes, seated on the king's throne, allowed to issue
          whatever commands he pleased, to eat, drink, and enjoy himself, and
          to lie with the king's concubines. But at the end of the five days
          he was stripped of his royal robes, scourged, and crucified.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a> This
          custom might perhaps have been explained as merely a grim jest
          perpetrated in a season of jollity at the expense of an unhappy
          criminal. But one circumstance—the leave given to the mock king to
          enjoy the king's concubines—is decisive against this
          interpretation. Considering the jealous seclusion of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> an oriental despot's harem we may be
          quite certain that permission to invade it would never have been
          granted by the despot, least of all to a condemned criminal, except
          for the very gravest cause. This cause could hardly be other than
          that the condemned man was about to die in the king's stead, and
          that to make the substitution perfect it was necessary he should
          enjoy the full rights of royalty during his brief reign. There is
          nothing surprising in this substitution. The rule that the king
          must be put to death either on the appearance of any symptom of
          bodily decay or at the end of a fixed period is certainly one
          which, sooner or later, the kings would seek to abolish or modify.
          We have seen that in Ethiopia and Sofala the rule was boldly set
          aside by enlightened monarchs; and that in Calicut the old custom
          of killing the king at the end of twelve years was changed into a
          permission granted to any one at the end of the twelve years'
          period to attack the king, and, in the event of killing him, to
          reign in his stead; though, as the king took care at these times to
          be surrounded by his guards, the permission was little more than a
          form. Another way of modifying the stern old rule is seen in the
          Babylonian custom just described. When the time drew near for the
          king to be put to death (in Babylon this appears to have been at
          the end of a single year's reign) he abdicated for a few days,
          during which a temporary king reigned and suffered in his stead. At
          first the temporary king may have been an innocent person, possibly
          a member of the king's own family; but with the growth of
          civilisation the sacrifice of an innocent person would be revolting
          to the public sentiment, and accordingly a condemned criminal would
          be invested with the brief and fatal sovereignty. In <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the sequel we shall find other examples
          of a dying criminal representing a dying god. For we must not
          forget that the king is slain in his character of a god, his death
          and resurrection, as the only means of perpetuating the divine life
          unimpaired, being deemed necessary for the salvation of his people
          and the world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some places
          this modified form of the old custom has been further softened
          down. The king still abdicates annually for a short time and his
          place is filled by a more or less nominal sovereign; but at the
          close of his short reign the latter is no longer killed, though
          sometimes a mock execution still survives as a memorial of the time
          when he was actually put to death. To take examples. In the month
          of Méac (February) the King of Cambodia annually abdicated for
          three days. During this time he performed no act of authority, he
          did not touch the seals, he did not even receive the revenues which
          fell due. In his stead there reigned a temporary king called Sdach
          Méac, that is, King February. The office of temporary king was
          hereditary in a family distantly connected with the royal house,
          the sons succeeding the fathers and the younger brothers the elder
          brothers, just as in the succession to the real sovereignty. On a
          favourable day fixed by the astrologers the temporary king was
          conducted by the mandarins in triumphal procession. He rode one of
          the royal elephants, seated in the royal palanquin, and escorted by
          soldiers who, dressed in appropriate costumes, represented the
          neighbouring peoples of Siam, Annam, Laos, and so on. Instead of
          the golden crown he wore a peaked white cap, and his regalia,
          instead of being of gold encrusted with diamonds, were of rough
          wood. After paying homage to the real king, from whom he received
          the sovereignty for three days, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> together with all the revenues accruing
          during that time (though this last custom has been omitted for some
          time), he moved in procession round the palace and through the
          streets of the capital. On the third day, after the usual
          procession, the temporary king gave orders that the elephants
          should trample under foot the <span class="tei tei-q">“mountain of
          rice,”</span> which was a scaffold of bamboo surrounded by sheaves
          of rice. The people gathered up the rice, each man taking home a
          little with him to secure a good harvest. Some of it was also taken
          to the king, who had it cooked and presented to the monks.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Siam on the
          sixth day of the moon in the sixth month (the end of April) a
          temporary king is appointed, who for three days enjoys the royal
          prerogatives, the real king remaining shut up in his palace. This
          temporary king sends his numerous satellites in all directions to
          seize and confiscate whatever they can find in the bazaar and open
          shops; even the ships and junks which arrive in harbour during the
          three days are confiscated to him and must be redeemed. He goes to
          a field in the middle of the city, whither is brought a gilded
          plough drawn by gaily-decked oxen. After the plough has been
          anointed and the oxen rubbed with incense, the mock king traces
          nine furrows with the plough, followed by aged dames of the palace
          scattering the first seed of the season. As soon as the nine
          furrows are drawn, the crowd of spectators rushes in and scrambles
          for the seed which has just been sown, believing that, mixed with
          the seed-rice, it will ensure a plentiful crop. Then the oxen are
          unyoked, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg
          230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          rice, maize, sesame, sago, bananas, sugar-cane, melons, etc. are
          set before them; whatever they eat first will, it is thought, be
          dear in the year following, though some people interpret the omen
          in the opposite sense. During this time the temporary king stands
          leaning against a tree with his right foot resting on his left
          knee. From standing thus on one foot he is popularly known as King
          Hop; but his official title is Phaya Phollathep, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lord of the Heavenly Hosts.”</span><a id="noteref_789"
          name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> He is
          a sort of Minister of Agriculture; all disputes about fields, rice,
          and so on, are referred to him. There is moreover another ceremony
          in which he personates the king. It takes place in the second month
          (which falls in the cold season) and lasts three days. He is
          conducted in procession to an open place opposite the Temple of the
          Brahmans, where there are a number of poles dressed like May-poles,
          upon which the Brahmans swing. All the while that they swing and
          dance, the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts has to stand on one foot upon
          a seat which is made of bricks plastered over, covered with a white
          cloth, and hung with tapestry. He is supported by a wooden frame
          with a gilt canopy, and two Brahmans stand one on each side of him.
          The dancing Brahmans carry buffalo horns with which they draw water
          from a large copper caldron and sprinkle it on the people; this is
          supposed to bring good luck, causing the people to dwell in peace
          and quiet, health and prosperity. The time during which the Lord of
          the Heavenly Hosts has to stand on one foot is about three hours.
          This is thought <span class="tei tei-q">“to prove the dispositions
          of the Devattas and spirits.”</span> If he lets his foot down
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name=

          family enslaved by the king; as it is believed to be a bad omen,
          portending destruction to the state, and instability to the throne.
          But if he stand firm he is believed to have gained a victory over
          evil spirits, and he has moreover the privilege, ostensibly at
          least, of seizing any ship which may enter the harbour during these
          three days, and taking its contents, and also of entering any open
          shop in the town and carrying away what he chooses.”</span><a id=

          on the first day of the solar year by Coptic reckoning, that is on
          10th September, when the Nile has generally reached its highest
          point, the regular government is suspended for three days and every
          town chooses its own ruler. This temporary lord wears a sort of
          tall fool's cap and a long flaxen beard, and is enveloped in a
          strange mantle. With a wand of office in his hand and attended by
          men disguised as scribes, executioners, etc., he proceeds to the
          Governor's house. The latter allows himself to be deposed; and the
          mock king, mounting the throne, holds a tribunal, to the decisions
          of which even the governor and his officials must bow. After three
          days the mock king is condemned to death; the envelope or shell in
          which he was encased is committed to the flames, and from its ashes
          the Fellah creeps forth.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
          temporary king occupies the throne, not annually, but once for all
          at the beginning of each reign. Thus in the kingdom of Jambi (in
          Sumatra) it is the custom that at the beginning of a new reign a
          man of the people should occupy the throne and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> exercise the royal prerogatives for a
          single day. The origin of the custom is explained by a tradition
          that there were once five royal brothers, the four elder of whom
          all declined the crown on the ground of various bodily defects,
          leaving it to their youngest brother. But the eldest occupied the
          throne for one day, and reserved for his descendants a similar
          privilege at the beginning of every reign. Thus the office of
          temporary king is hereditary in a family akin to the royal
          house.<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href=

          Bilaspur it seems to be the custom, after the death of a Rajah, for
          a Brahman to eat rice out of the dead Rajah's hand, and then to
          occupy the throne for a year. At the end of the year the Brahman
          receives presents and is dismissed from the territory, being
          forbidden apparently to return. <span class="tei tei-q">“The idea
          seems to be that the spirit of the Rájá enters into the Bráhman who

          hand when he is dead, as the Brahman is apparently carefully
          watched during the whole year, and not allowed to go away.”</span>
          The same or a similar custom is believed to obtain among the hill

          the installation of a prince of Carinthia a peasant, in whose
          family the office was hereditary, ascended a marble stone which
          stood surrounded by meadows in a spacious valley; on his right
          stood a black mother-cow, on his left an ugly mare. A rustic crowd
          gathered about him. Then the future prince, dressed as a peasant
          and carrying a shepherd's staff, drew near, attended by courtiers
          and magistrates. On perceiving him the peasant called out,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is this whom I see coming so proudly

          land.”</span> The peasant was then prevailed on to surrender the
          marble seat to the prince on condition of receiving sixty pence,
          the cow and mare, and exemption from taxes. But before yielding his
          place he gave the prince a light blow on the cheek.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some points
          about these temporary kings deserve to be specially noticed before
          we pass to the next branch of the evidence. In the first place, the
          Cambodian and Siamese examples bring clearly out the fact that it
          is especially the divine or supernatural functions of the king
          which are transferred to his temporary substitute. This appears
          from the belief that by keeping up his foot the temporary king of
          Siam gained a victory over the evil spirits; whereas by letting it
          down he imperilled the existence of the state. Again, the Cambodian
          ceremony of trampling down the <span class="tei tei-q">“mountain of
          rice,”</span> and the Siamese ceremony of opening the ploughing and
          sowing, are charms to produce a plentiful harvest, as appears from
          the belief that those who carry home some of the trampled rice or
          of the seed sown will thereby secure a good crop. But the task of
          making the crops grow, thus deputed to the temporary kings, is one
          of the supernatural functions regularly supposed to be discharged
          by kings in primitive society. The rule that the mock king must
          stand on one foot upon a raised seat in the rice-field was perhaps
          originally meant as a charm to make the crop grow high; at least
          this was the object of a similar ceremony observed by the old
          Prussians. The tallest girl, standing on one foot upon a seat, with
          her lap full of cakes, a cup of brandy in her right hand and a
          piece of elm-bark <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg
          234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          or linden-bark in her left, prayed to the god Waizganthos that the
          flax might grow as high as she was standing. Then, after draining
          the cup, she had it refilled, and poured the brandy on the ground
          as an offering to Waizganthos, and threw down the cakes for his
          attendant sprites. If she remained steady on one foot throughout
          the ceremony, it was an omen that the flax crop would be good; but
          if she let her foot down, it was feared that the crop might
          fail.<a id="noteref_795" name="noteref_795" href=
          "#note_795"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          gilded plough with which the Siamese mock king opens the ploughing
          may be compared with the bronze ploughs which the Etruscans
          employed at the ceremony of founding cities;<a id="noteref_796"
          name="noteref_796" href="#note_796"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a> in
          both cases the use of iron was probably forbidden on superstitious
          grounds.<a id="noteref_797" name="noteref_797" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another point to
          notice about these temporary kings is that in two places (Cambodia
          and Jambi) they come of a stock which is believed to be akin to the
          royal family. If the view here taken of the origin of these
          temporary kingships is correct, the fact that the temporary king is
          sometimes of the same race as the real king admits of a ready
          explanation. When the king first succeeded in getting the life of
          another accepted as a sacrifice in lieu of his own, he would have
          to show that the death of that other would serve the purpose quite
          as well as his own would have done. Now it was as a god that the
          king had to die; therefore the substitute who died for him had to
          be invested, at least for the occasion, with the divine attributes
          of the king. This, as we have just seen, was certainly the case
          with the temporary kings of Siam and Cambodia; <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they were invested with the
          supernatural functions, which in an earlier stage of society were
          the special attributes of the king. But no one could so well
          represent the king in his divine character as his son, who might be
          supposed to share the divine afflatus of his father. No one,
          therefore, could so appropriately die for the king and, through
          him, for the whole people, as the king's son. There is evidence
          that amongst the Semites of Western Asia (the very region where the
          redemption of the king's life by the sacrifice of another comes out
          so unmistakably in the Sacaean festival) the king, in a time of
          national danger, sometimes gave his own son to die as a sacrifice
          for the people. Thus Philo of Byblus, in his work on the Jews,
          says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It was an ancient custom in a crisis
          of great danger that the ruler of a city or nation should give his
          beloved son to die for the whole people, as a ransom offered to the
          avenging demons; and the children thus offered were slain with
          mystic rites. So Cronus, whom the Phoenicians call Israel, being
          king of the land and having an only-begotten son called Jeoud (for
          in the Phoenician tongue Jeoud signifies <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘only-begotten’</span>), dressed him in royal robes and
          sacrificed him upon an altar in a time of war, when the country was
          in great danger from the enemy.”</span><a id="noteref_798" name=

          the King of Moab was besieged by the Israelites and hard beset, he
          took his eldest son, who should have reigned in his stead, and

          amongst the Semites the practice of sacrificing their children was
          not confined to kings. In times of great calamity, such as
          pestilence, drought, or defeat in war, the Phoenicians <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> used to sacrifice one of their dearest
          to Baal. <span class="tei tei-q">“Phoenician history,”</span> says
          an ancient writer, <span class="tei tei-q">“is full of such
          sacrifices.”</span><a id="noteref_800" name="noteref_800" href=

          the Carthaginians were defeated and besieged by Agathocles, they
          ascribed their disasters to the wrath of Baal; for whereas in
          former times they had been wont to sacrifice to him their own
          children, they had latterly fallen into the habit of buying
          children and rearing them to be victims. So, to appease the angry
          god, two hundred children of the noblest families were picked out
          for sacrifice, and the tale of victims was swelled by not less than
          three hundred more who volunteered to die for the fatherland. They
          were sacrificed by being placed, one by one, on the sloping hands
          of the brazen image, from which they rolled into a pit of
          fire.<a id="noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href=

          aristocracy thus adopted the practice of sacrificing other people's
          children instead of their own, kings may very well have followed or
          set the example. A final mitigation of the custom would be the
          substitution of condemned criminals for innocent victims. Such a
          substitution is known to have taken place in the human sacrifices
          annually offered in Rhodes to Baal.<a id="noteref_802" name=

          sacrificing children, especially the first born, is not peculiarly
          Semitic. In some tribes of New South Wales the first-born child of

          "page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class=

          winter were jumbled together in a bad season, and the fruits of the
          earth would not ripen, the soothsayers enjoined it. At that time a
          great pillar of iron is said to have stood at the entrance of the
          capital, which by the advice of the soothsayers was broken down by
          order of the king, upon which the seasons became regular again. To
          avert the recurrence of such a confusion of the seasons, the
          soothsayers are reported to have enjoined the king to pour human
          blood once a year on the base of the broken shaft of the pillar,
          and also upon the throne. Since then certain families are obliged
          to deliver up their first-born sons, who are sacrificed at an

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The condemnation
          and pretended death by fire of the mock king in Egypt is probably a
          reminiscence of a real custom of burning him. Evidence of a
          practice of burning divine personages will be forthcoming later on.
          In Bilaspur the expulsion of the Brahman who had occupied the
          king's throne for a year is perhaps a substitute for putting him to
          death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The explanation
          here given of the custom of killing divine persons assumes, or at
          least is readily combined with, the idea that the soul of the slain
          divinity is transmitted to his successor. Of this transmission I
          have no direct proof; and so far a link in <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the chain of evidence is wanting. But if I
          cannot prove by actual examples this succession to the soul of the
          slain god, it can at least be made probable that such a succession
          was supposed to take place. For it has been already shown that the
          soul of the incarnate deity is often supposed to transmigrate at
          death into another incarnation;<a id="noteref_807" name=
          "noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a> and
          if this takes place when the death is a natural one, there seems no
          reason why it should not take place when the death is a violent
          one. Certainly the idea that the soul of a dying person may be
          transmitted to his successor is perfectly familiar to primitive
          peoples. In Nias the eldest son usually succeeds his father in the
          chieftainship. But if from any bodily or mental defect the eldest
          son is incapacitated from ruling, the father determines in his
          life-time which of his sons shall succeed him. In order, however,
          to establish his right of succession it is necessary that the son
          upon whom his father's choice falls shall catch in his mouth or in
          a bag the last breath, and with it the soul, of the dying chief.
          For whoever catches his last breath is chief equally with the
          appointed successor. Hence the other brothers, and sometimes also
          strangers, crowd round the dying man to catch his soul as it
          passes. The houses in Nias are raised above the ground on posts,
          and it has happened that when the dying man lay with his face on
          the floor, one of the candidates has bored a hole in the floor and
          sucked in the chief's last breath through a bamboo tube. When the
          chief has no son, his soul is caught in a bag, which is fastened to
          an image made to represent the deceased; the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> soul is then believed to pass into the
          image.<a id="noteref_808" name="noteref_808" href=

          Amongst the Takilis or Carrier Indians of North-West America, when
          a corpse is burned the priest pretends to catch the soul of the
          deceased in his hands, which he closes with many gesticulations. He
          then communicates the captured soul to the dead man's successor by
          throwing his hands towards and blowing upon him. The person to whom
          the soul is thus communicated takes the name and rank of the
          deceased. On the death of a chief the priest thus fills a
          responsible and influential position, for he may transmit the soul
          to whom he will, though, doubtless, he generally follows the
          regular line of succession.<a id="noteref_809" name="noteref_809"

          Algonkin women who wished to become mothers flocked to the side of
          a dying person in the hope of receiving and being impregnated by
          the passing soul. Amongst the Seminoles of Florida when a woman
          died in childbed the infant was held over her face to receive her

          <span style="font-size: 144%">§ 2.—Killing the
          tree-spirit.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains to
          ask what light the custom of killing the divine king or priest
          sheds upon the subject of our inquiry. In the first chapter we saw
          reason to suppose that the King of the Wood was regarded as an
          incarnation of the tree-spirit or of the spirit of vegetation, and
          that as such he would be endowed, in the belief of his worshippers,
          with a supernatural power of making the trees to bear fruit, the
          crops to grow, and so on. His life must therefore have been held
          very precious by his worshippers, and was probably hedged in by a
          system of elaborate precautions or taboos like those by which, in
          so many places, the life of the god-man has been guarded against
          the malignant influence of demons and sorcerers. But we have seen
          that the very value attached to the life of the man-god
          necessitates his violent death as the only means of preserving it
          from the inevitable decay of age. The same reasoning would apply to
          the King of the Wood; he too had to be killed in order that the
          divine spirit, incarnate in him, might be transferred in unabated
          vigour to his successor. The rule that he held office till a
          stronger should slay him might be supposed to secure both the
          preservation of his divine life in full vigour and its transference
          to a suitable successor as soon as that vigour began to be
          impaired. For so long as he could maintain his position by the
          strong hand, it might be inferred that his natural force was not
          abated; whereas his defeat and death at the hands of another proved
          that his strength was beginning to fail and that it was time his
          divine life should be lodged in a less <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> dilapidated tabernacle. This explanation of
          the rule that the King of the Wood had to be slain by his successor
          at least renders that rule perfectly intelligible. Moreover it is
          countenanced by the analogy of the Chitombé, upon whose life the
          existence of the world was supposed to hang, and who was therefore
          slain by his successor as soon as he showed signs of breaking up.
          Again, the terms on which in later times the King of Calicut held
          office are identical with those attached to the office of King of
          the Wood, except that whereas the former might be assailed by a
          candidate at any time, the King of Calicut might only be attacked
          once every twelve years. But as the leave granted to the King of
          Calicut to reign so long as he could defend himself against all
          comers was a mitigation of the old rule which set a fixed term to
          his life, so we may conjecture that the similar permission granted
          to the King of the Wood was a mitigation of an older custom of
          putting him to death at the end of a set period. In both cases the
          new rule gave to the god-man at least a chance for his life, which
          under the old rule was denied him; and people probably reconciled
          themselves to the change by reflecting that so long as the god-man
          could maintain himself by the sword against all assaults, there was
          no reason to apprehend that the fatal decay had set in.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conjecture
          that the King of the Wood was formerly put to death at the expiry
          of a set term, without being allowed a chance for his life, will be
          confirmed if evidence can be adduced of a custom of periodically
          killing his counterparts, the human representatives of the
          tree-spirit, in Northern Europe. Now in point of fact such a custom
          has left unmistakable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
          242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          traces of itself in the rural festivals of the peasantry. To take
          examples.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Lower Bavaria
          the Whitsuntide representative of the tree-spirit—the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pfingstl</span></span> as he was called—was
          clad from top to toe in leaves and flowers. On his head he wore a
          high pointed cap, the ends of which rested on his shoulders, only
          two holes being left in it for his eyes. The cap was covered with
          water flowers and surmounted with a nosegay of peonies. The sleeves
          of his coat were also made of water-plants, and the rest of his
          body was enveloped in alder and hazel leaves. On each side of him
          marched a boy holding up one of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pfingstl</span></span>'s arms. These two boys
          carried drawn swords, and so did most of the others who formed the
          procession. They stopped at every house where they hoped to receive
          a present; and the people, in hiding, soused the leaf-clad boy with
          water. All rejoiced when he was well drenched. Finally he waded
          into the brook up to his middle; whereupon one of the boys,
          standing on the bridge, pretended to cut off his head.<a id=

          Wurmlingen in Swabia a score of young fellows dress themselves on
          Whit-Monday in white shirts and white trousers, with red scarves
          round their waists and swords hanging from the scarves. They ride
          on horse-back into the wood, led by two trumpeters blowing their
          trumpets. In the wood they cut down leafy oak branches, in which
          they envelop from head to foot him who was the last of their number
          to ride out of the village. His legs, however, are encased
          separately, so that he may be able to mount his horse again.
          Further, they give him a long artificial neck, with an <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> artificial head and a false face on the
          top of it. Then a May-tree is cut, generally an aspen or beech
          about ten feet high; and being decked with coloured handkerchiefs
          and ribbons it is entrusted to a special <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“May-bearer.”</span> The cavalcade then returns with
          music and song to the village. Amongst the personages who figure in
          the procession are a Moorish king with a sooty face and a crown on
          his head, a Dr. Iron-Beard, a corporal, and an executioner. They
          halt on the village green, and each of the characters makes a
          speech in rhyme. The executioner announces that the leaf-clad man
          has been condemned to death and cuts off his false head. Then the
          riders race to the May-tree, which has been set up a little way
          off. The first man who succeeds in wrenching it from the ground as
          he gallops past keeps it with all its decorations. The ceremony is
          observed every second or third year.<a id="noteref_814" name=

          the wood, and fire at him with blank muskets. He falls like dead to

          to life again. At this they rejoice and binding him fast on a

          reeled about with strange gestures and spirted blood on the people
          from bladders which they carried. When they were down, the huntsmen
          placed them on boards and carried them to the alehouse, the miners

          lane across which a cord is stretched. He stumbles over the cord
          and, falling to the ground, is overtaken and caught by his
          pursuers. The executioner runs up and stabs with his sword a
          bladder filled with blood which the Wild Man wears round his body;
          so the Wild Man dies, while a stream of blood reddens the ground.
          Next day a straw-man, made up to look like the Wild Man, is placed
          on a litter, and, accompanied by a great crowd, is taken to a pool
          into which it is thrown by the executioner. The ceremony is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“burying the Carnival.”</span><a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Semic
          (Bohemia) the custom of beheading the King is observed on
          Whit-Monday. A troop of young people disguise themselves; each is
          girt with a girdle of bark and carries a wooden sword and a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name=

          willow-bark. The King wears a robe of tree-bark adorned with
          flowers, on his head is a crown of bark decked with flowers and
          branches, his feet are wound about with ferns, a mask hides his
          face, and for a sceptre he has a hawthorn switch in his hand. A lad
          leads him through the village by a rope fastened to his foot, while
          the rest dance about, blow their trumpets, and whistle. In every
          farmhouse the King is chased round the room, and one of the troop,
          amid much noise and outcry, strikes with his sword a blow on the
          King's robe of bark till it rings again. Then a gratuity is
          demanded.<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href=

          ceremony of decapitation, which is here somewhat slurred over, is
          carried out with a greater semblance of reality in other parts of
          Bohemia. Thus in some villages of the Königgrätz district on
          Whit-Monday the girls assemble under one lime-tree and the young
          men under another, all dressed in their best and tricked out with
          ribbons. The young men twine a garland for the Queen and the girls
          for the King. When they have chosen the King and Queen they all go
          in procession, two and two, to the alehouse, from the balcony of
          which the crier proclaims the names of the King and Queen. Both are
          then invested with the insignia of their dignity and are crowned
          with the garlands, while the music plays up. Then some one gets on
          a bench and accuses the King of various offences, such as
          ill-treating the cattle. The King appeals to witnesses and a trial
          ensues, at the close of which the judge, who carries a white wand
          as his badge of office, pronounces a verdict of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“guilty”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“not
          guilty.”</span> If the verdict is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“guilty”</span> the judge breaks his wand, the

          "Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> King kneels on a
          white cloth, all heads are bared, and a soldier sets three or four
          hats, one above the other, on the King's head. The judge then
          pronounces the word <span class="tei tei-q">“guilty”</span> thrice
          in a loud voice, and orders the crier to behead the King. The crier
          obeys by striking off the King's hats with his wooden sword.<a id=

          our purpose, the most instructive of these mimic executions is the
          following Bohemian one, which has been in part described

          some places of the Pilsen district (Bohemia) on Whit-Monday the
          King is dressed in bark, ornamented with flowers and ribbons; he
          wears a crown of gilt paper and rides a horse, which is also decked
          with flowers. Attended by a judge, an executioner and other
          characters, and followed by a train of soldiers, all mounted, he
          rides to the village square, where a hut or arbour of green boughs
          has been erected under the May-trees, which are firs, freshly cut,
          peeled to the top, and dressed with flowers and ribbons. After the
          dames and maidens of the village have been criticised and a frog
          beheaded, in the way already described, the cavalcade rides to a
          place previously determined upon, in a straight, broad street. Here
          they draw up in two lines and the King takes to flight. He is given
          a short start and rides off at full speed, pursued by the whole
          troop. If they fail to catch him he remains King for another year,
          and his companions must pay his score at the alehouse in the
          evening. But if they overtake and catch him he is scourged with
          hazel rods or beaten with the wooden swords and compelled to
          dismount. Then the executioner asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall
          I behead this King?”</span> The answer is given, <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“One, two, three, let the King headless
          be!”</span> he strikes off the King's crown. Amid the loud cries of
          the bystanders the King sinks to the ground; then he is laid on a
          bier and carried to the nearest farmhouse.<a id="noteref_821" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          personages who are thus slain in mimicry it is impossible not to
          recognise representatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of
          vegetation, as he is supposed to manifest himself in spring. The
          bark, leaves, and flowers in which the actors are dressed, and the
          season of the year at which they appear, show that they belong to
          the same class as the Grass King, King of the May,
          Jack-in-the-Green, and other representatives of the vernal spirit
          of vegetation which we examined in the first chapter. As if to
          remove any possible doubt on this head, we find that in two
          cases<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href=
          "#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> these
          slain men are brought into direct connection with May-trees, which
          are (as we have seen) the impersonal, as the May King, Grass King,
          etc., are the personal representatives of the tree-spirit. The
          drenching of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pfingstl</span></span> with water and his
          wading up to the middle into the brook are, therefore, no doubt
          rain-charms like those which have been already described.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if these
          personages represent, as they certainly do, the spirit of
          vegetation in spring, the question arises, Why kill them? What is
          the object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and
          above all in spring, when his services are most wanted? The only
          answer to this question seems to be given in the explanation
          already proposed of the custom of killing the divine king or
          priest. The divine life, incarnate in a material and mortal body,
          is liable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg
          248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to be tainted and corrupted by the weakness of the frail medium in
          which it is for a time enshrined; and if it is to be saved from the
          increasing enfeeblement which it must necessarily share with its
          human incarnation as he advances in years, it must be detached from
          him before, or at least as soon as, he exhibits signs of decay, in
          order to be transferred to a vigorous successor. This is done by
          killing the old representative of the god and conveying the divine
          spirit from him to a new incarnation. The killing of the god, that
          is, of his human incarnation, is, therefore, only a necessary step
          to his revival or resurrection in a better form. Far from being an
          extinction of the divine spirit, it is only the beginning of a
          purer and stronger manifestation of it. If this explanation holds
          good of the custom of killing divine kings and priests in general,
          it is still more obviously applicable to the custom of annually
          killing the representative of the tree-spirit or spirit of
          vegetation in spring. For the decay of vegetation in winter is
          readily interpreted by primitive man as an enfeeblement of the
          spirit of vegetation; the spirit has (he thinks) grown old and weak
          and must therefore be renovated by being slain and brought to life
          in a younger and fresher form. Thus the killing of the
          representative of the tree-spirit in spring is regarded as a means
          to promote and quicken the growth of vegetation. For the killing of
          the tree-spirit is associated always (we must suppose) implicitly,
          and sometimes explicitly also, with a revival or resurrection of
          him in a more youthful and vigorous form. Thus in the Saxon and
          Thüringen custom, after the Wild Man has been shot he is brought to
          life again by a doctor;<a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href=
          "#note_824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a> and
          in the Wurmlingen ceremony there <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> figures a Dr. Iron-Beard, who probably once
          played a similar part; certainly in another spring ceremony (to be
          described presently) Dr. Iron-Beard pretends to restore a dead man
          to life. But of this revival or resurrection of the god we shall
          have more to say anon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The points of
          similarity between these North European personages and the subject
          of our inquiry—the King of the Wood or priest of Nemi—are
          sufficiently striking. In these northern maskers we see kings,
          whose dress of bark and leaves, along with the hut of green boughs
          and the fir-trees under which they hold their court, proclaim them
          unmistakably as, like their Italian counterpart, Kings of the Wood.
          Like him they die a violent death; but like him they may escape
          from it for a time by their bodily strength and agility; for in
          several of these northern customs the flight and pursuit of the
          king is a prominent part of the ceremony, and in one case at least
          if the king can outrun his pursuers he retains his life and his
          office for another year. In this last case, in fact, the king holds
          office on condition of running for his life once a year, just as
          the King of Calicut in later times held office on condition of
          defending his life against all comers once every twelve years, and
          just as the priest of Nemi held office on condition of defending
          himself against any assault at any time. In all these cases the
          life of the god-man is prolonged on condition of showing, in a
          severe physical contest of fight or flight, that his bodily
          strength is not decayed, and that, therefore, the violent death,
          which sooner or later is inevitable, may for the present be
          postponed. With regard to flight it is noticeable that flight
          figured conspicuously both in the legend and the practice of the
          King of the Wood. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
          250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          had to be a runaway slave (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">fugitivus</span></span>) in memory of the
          flight of Orestes, the traditional founder of the worship; hence
          the Kings of the Wood are described by an ancient writer as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“both strong of hand and fleet of
          foot.”</span><a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825" href=
          "#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a>
          Perhaps if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove fully we might
          find that the king was allowed a chance for his life by flight,
          like his Bohemian brother. We may conjecture that the annual flight
          of the priestly king at Rome (<span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">regifugium</span></span>)<a id="noteref_826"
          name="noteref_826" href="#note_826"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> was
          at first a flight of the same kind; in other words, that he was
          originally one of those divine kings who are either put to death
          after a fixed period or allowed to prove by the strong hand or the
          fleet foot that their divinity is vigorous and unimpaired. One more
          point of resemblance may be noted between the Italian King of the
          Wood and his northern counterparts. In Saxony and Thüringen the
          representative of the tree-spirit, after being killed, is brought
          to life again by a doctor. This is exactly what legend affirmed to
          have happened to the first King of the Wood at Nemi, Hippolytus or
          Virbius, who after he had been killed by his horses was restored to
          life by the physician Aesculapius.<a id="noteref_827" name=
          "noteref_827" href="#note_827"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a> Such
          a legend tallies well with the theory that the slaying of the King
          of the Wood was only a step to his revival or resurrection in his
          successor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          assumed that the mock killing of the Wild Man and of the King in
          North European folk-custom is a modern substitute for an ancient
          custom of killing them in earnest. Those who best know the tenacity
          of life possessed by folk-custom and its tendency, with the growth
          of civilisation, to dwindle from solemn ritual into mere pageant
          and pastime, will be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg
          251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          least likely to question the truth of this assumption. That human
          sacrifices were commonly offered by the ancestors of the civilised
          races of North Europe (Celts, Teutons, and Slavs) is certain.<a id=

          not, therefore, surprising that the modern peasant should do in
          mimicry what his forefathers did in reality. We know as a matter of
          fact that in other parts of the world mock human sacrifices have
          been substituted for real ones. Thus Captain Bourke was informed by
          an old chief that the Indians of Arizona used to offer human
          sacrifices at the Feast of Fire when the days are shortest. The
          victim had his throat cut, his breast opened, and his heart taken
          out by one of the priests. This custom was abolished by the
          Mexicans, but for a long time afterwards a modified form of it was
          secretly observed as follows. The victim, generally a young man,
          had his throat cut, and blood was allowed to flow freely; but the
          medicine-men sprinkled <span class="tei tei-q">“medicine”</span> on
          the gash, which soon healed up, and the man recovered.<a id=

          the ritual of Artemis at Halae in Attica, a man's throat was cut
          and the blood allowed to gush out, but he was not killed.<a id=

          the funeral of a chief in Nias slaves are sacrificed; a little of
          their hair is cut off, and then they are beheaded. The victims are
          generally purchased for the purpose, and their number is
          proportioned to the wealth and power of the deceased. But if the
          number required is excessively great or cannot be procured, some of
          the chief's own slaves undergo a sham sacrifice. They are told, and
          believe, that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg
          252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          they are about to be decapitated; their heads are placed on a log
          and their necks struck with the back of a sword. The fright drives
          some of them crazy.<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href=

          a Hindoo has killed or ill-treated an ape, a bird of prey of a
          certain kind, or a cobra capella, in the presence of the
          worshippers of Vishnu, he must expiate his offence by the pretended
          sacrifice and resurrection of a human being. An incision is made in
          the victim's arm, the blood flows, he grows faint, falls, and
          feigns to die. Afterwards he is brought to life by being sprinkled
          with blood drawn from the thigh of a worshipper of Vishnu. The
          crowd of spectators is fully convinced of the reality of this
          simulated death and resurrection.<a id="noteref_832" name=

          Sometimes the mock sacrifice is carried out, not on a living person

          tigers, or human beings is required, an image of a lion, tiger, or
          man shall be made with butter, paste, or barley meal, and
          sacrificed instead.<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href=

          Colonel Dalton was told that in some of their villages the Bhagats
          (Hindooised Oraons) <span class="tei tei-q">“annually make an image
          of a man in wood, put clothes and ornaments on it, and present it
          before the altar of a Mahádeo. The person who officiates as priest
          on the occasion says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘O, Mahádeo, we
          sacrifice this man to you according to ancient customs. Give us
          rain in due season, and a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg

          plentiful harvest.’</span> Then with one stroke of the axe the head
          of the image is struck off, and the body is removed and
          buried.”</span><a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far I have
          offered an explanation of the rule which required that the priest
          of Nemi should be slain by his successor. The explanation claims to
          be no more than probable; our scanty knowledge of the custom and of
          its history forbids it to be more. But its probability will be
          augmented in proportion to the extent to which the motives and
          modes of thought which it assumes can be proved to have operated in
          primitive society. Hitherto the god with whose death and
          resurrection we have been chiefly concerned has been the tree-god.
          Tree-worship may perhaps be regarded (though this is a conjecture)
          as occupying an intermediate place in the history of religion,
          between the religion of the hunter and shepherd on the one side,
          whose gods are mostly animals, and the religion of the husbandman
          on the other hand, in whose worship the cultivated plants play a
          leading part. If then I can show that the custom of killing the god
          and the belief in his resurrection originated, or at least existed,
          in the hunting and pastoral stage of society, when the slain god
          was an animal, and survived into the agricultural stage, when the
          slain god was the corn or a human being representing the corn, the
          probability of my explanation will have been considerably
          increased. This I shall attempt to do in the remainder of this
          chapter, in the course of which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> I hope to clear up some obscurities which
          still remain, and to answer some objections which may have
          suggested themselves to the reader.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We start from
          the point at which we left off—the spring customs of European
          peasantry. Besides the ceremonies already described there are two
          kindred sets of observances in which the simulated death of a
          divine or supernatural being is a leading feature. These
          observances are commonly known as <span class="tei tei-q">“Burying
          the Carnival,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Driving or
          carrying out Death.”</span> Both customs are chiefly practised, or
          at least best known, on German and Slavonic ground. The former
          custom is observed on the last day of the Carnival, namely, Shrove
          Tuesday (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Fastnacht</span></span>), or
          on the first day of Lent, namely, Ash Wednesday. The latter custom
          is commonly observed on the Fourth Sunday in Lent, which hence gets
          the name of Dead Sunday (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Todtensonntag</span></span>); but in some
          places it is observed a week earlier; in others again, as amongst
          the Czechs of Bohemia, a week later. Originally the date of the
          celebration of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Carrying out
          Death”</span> appears not to have been fixed, but to have depended
          on the appearance of the first swallow or of some other natural
          phenomenon.<a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836" href=
          "#note_836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a> A
          Bohemian form of the custom of <span class="tei tei-q">“Burying the
          Carnival”</span> has been already described.<a id="noteref_837"
          name="noteref_837" href="#note_837"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a> The
          following Swabian form is obviously similar. In the neighbourhood
          of Tübingen on Shrove Tuesday a straw-man, called the Shrovetide
          Bear, is made up; he is dressed in a pair of old trousers, and a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name=
          "Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fresh black-pudding
          or two squirts filled with blood are inserted in his neck. After a
          formal condemnation he is beheaded, laid in a coffin, and on Ash
          Wednesday is buried in the churchyard. This is called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Burying the Carnival”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "de"><span style="font-style: italic">die Fastnacht

          Amongst some of the Saxons of Transylvania the Carnival is hung.
          Thus at Braller on Ash Wednesday or Shrove Tuesday two white and
          two chestnut horses draw a sledge on which is placed a straw-man
          swathed in a white cloth; beside him is a cart-wheel which is kept
          turning round. Two lads disguised as old men follow the sledge
          lamenting. The rest of the village lads, mounted on horseback and
          decked with ribbons, accompany the procession, which is headed by
          two girls crowned with evergreen and drawn in a waggon or sledge. A
          trial is held under a tree, at which lads disguised as soldiers
          pronounce sentence of death. The two old men try to rescue the
          straw-man and to fly with him, but to no purpose; he is caught by
          the two girls and handed over to the executioner, who hangs him on
          a tree. In vain the old men try to climb up the tree and take him
          down; they always tumble down, and at last in despair they throw
          themselves on the ground and weep and howl for the hanged man. An
          official then makes a speech in which he declares that the Carnival
          was condemned to death because he had done them harm, by wearing
          out their shoes and making them tired and sleepy.<a id=

          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Burial of Carnival”</span> in
          Lechrain, a man dressed as a woman in black clothes is carried on a
          litter or bier by four men; he is lamented over by men disguised as
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name=
          "Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> women in black
          clothes, then thrown down before the village dung-heap, drenched
          with water, buried in the dung-heap, and covered with straw.<a id=

          Similarly in Schörzingen, near Schömberg, the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Carnival (Shrovetide) Fool”</span> was carried all
          about the village on a bier, preceded by a man dressed in white,
          and followed by a devil who was dressed in black and carried
          chains, which he clanked. One of the train collected gifts. After
          the procession the Fool was buried under straw and dung.<a id=

          Rottweil the <span class="tei tei-q">“Carnival Fool”</span> is made
          drunk on Ash Wednesday and buried under straw amid loud

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a> In
          Wurmlingen the Fool is represented by a young fellow enveloped in
          straw, who is led about the village by a rope as a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Bear”</span> on Shrove Tuesday and the preceding day.
          He dances to the flute. Then on Ash Wednesday a straw-man is made,
          placed on a trough, carried out of the village to the sound of
          drums and mournful music, and buried in a field.<a id="noteref_843"
          name="noteref_843" href="#note_843"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">843</span></span></a> In
          Altdorf and Weingarten on Ash Wednesday the Fool, represented by a
          straw-man, is carried about and then thrown into the water to the
          accompaniment of melancholy music. In other villages of Swabia the
          part of fool is played by a live person, who is thrown into the
          water after being carried about in procession.<a id="noteref_844"
          name="noteref_844" href="#note_844"><span class=

          Balwe, in Westphalia, a straw-man is made on Shrove Tuesday and
          thrown into the river amid rejoicings. This is called, as usual,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Burying the Carnival.”</span><a id=

          the evening of Shrove Tuesday, the Esthonians make a <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> straw figure called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">metsik</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wood-spirit;”</span> one year it is dressed with a
          man's coat and hat, next year with a hood and a petticoat. This
          figure is stuck on a long pole, carried across the boundary of the
          village with loud cries of joy, and fastened to the top of a tree
          in the wood. The ceremony is believed to be a protection against
          all kinds of misfortune.<a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846"
          href="#note_846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a>
          Sometimes the resurrection of the pretended dead person is enacted.
          Thus, in some parts of Swabia, on Shrove Tuesday Dr. Iron-Beard
          professes to bleed a sick man, who thereupon falls as dead to the
          ground; but the doctor at last restores him to life by blowing air
          into him through a tube.<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847"
          href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> In
          the Harz mountains, when Carnival is over, a man is laid on a
          baking-trough and carried with dirges to a grave; but in the grave,
          instead of the man, a glass of brandy is placed. A speech is
          delivered and then the people return to the village-green or
          meeting-place, where they smoke the long clay pipes which are
          distributed at funerals. On the morning of Shrove Tuesday in the
          following year the brandy is dug up and the festival begins by
          every one tasting the brandy which, as the phrase goes, has come to
          life again.<a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href=
          "#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ceremony of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Carrying out Death”</span> presents much
          the same features as <span class="tei tei-q">“Burying the
          Carnival;”</span> except that the figure of Death is oftener
          drowned or burned than buried, and that the carrying out of Death
          is generally followed by a ceremony, or at least accompanied by a
          profession, of bringing in Summer, Spring, or Life. Thus, in some
          villages of Thüringen on the Fourth Sunday of Lent, the children
          used to carry a puppet of birchen twigs through the village,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name=
          "Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and then threw it
          into a pool, while they sang, <span class="tei tei-q">“We carry the
          old Death out behind the herdsman's old house; we have got Summer,
          and Kroden's(?) power is destroyed.”</span><a id="noteref_849"

          one village of Thüringen (Dobschwitz near Gera), the ceremony of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Driving out Death”</span> is still
          annually observed on the 1st of March. The young people make up a
          figure of straw or the like materials, dress it in old clothes
          which they have begged from the houses in the village, and carry it
          out and throw it into the river. On returning to the village they
          announce the fact to the people, and receive eggs and other
          victuals as a reward. In other villages of Thüringen, in which the
          population was originally Slavonic, the carrying out of the puppet
          is accompanied with the singing of a song, which begins,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now we carry Death out of the village and
          Spring into the village.”</span><a id="noteref_850" name=

          hidden under a shroud. Others carry a beech branch, with an apple
          fastened to it for a head, in an open box. They sing, <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effigy of
          Death is often regarded with fear and treated with marks of hatred
          and contempt. In Lusatia the figure is sometimes made to look in at
          the window of a house, and it is believed that some one in the
          house will die within the year unless his life is redeemed by the
          payment of money.<a id="noteref_855" name="noteref_855" href=

          Again, after throwing the effigy away, the bearers sometimes run
          home lest Death should follow them; and if one of them falls in
          running, it is believed that he will die within the year.<a id=

          figure of Death is made out of a cross, with a head and mask stuck
          at the top, and a shirt stretched out on it. On the Fifth Sunday in
          Lent the boys take this effigy to the nearest brook or pool, and
          standing in a line throw it into the water. Then they all plunge in
          after it; but as soon as it is caught no one more may enter the
          water. The boy who did not enter the water or entered it last will
          die within the year, and he is obliged to carry the Death back to
          the village. The effigy is then burned.<a id="noteref_857" name=

          some villages of Austrian Silesia on the Saturday before Dead
          Sunday an effigy is made of old clothes, hay, and straw, for the
          purpose of driving Death out of the village. On Sunday the people,
          armed with sticks and straps, assemble before the house where the
          figure is lodged. Four lads then draw the effigy by cords through
          the village amid exultant shouts, while all the others beat it with
          their sticks and straps. On reaching a field which belongs to a
          neighbouring village they lay down the figure, cudgel it soundly,
          and scatter the fragments over the field. The people believe that
          the village from which Death has been thus carried out will be safe
          from any infectious disease for the whole year.<a id="noteref_860"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The custom of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“sawing the Old Woman,”</span> which is or
          used to be observed in Italy and Spain on the Fourth Sunday in
          Lent, is doubtless, as Grimm supposes, merely another form of the
          custom of <span class="tei tei-q">“carrying out Death.”</span> A
          great hideous figure representing the oldest woman of the village
          was dragged out and sawn in two, amid a prodigious noise made with
          cow-bells, pots and pans, etc.<a id="noteref_863" name=
          "noteref_863" href="#note_863"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a> In
          Palermo the ceremony used to be still more realistic. At Mid-Lent
          an old woman was drawn through the streets on a cart, attended by
          two men dressed in the costume of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Compagnia
          de'Bianchi</span></span>, a society or religious order whose
          function it was to attend and console prisoners condemned to death.
          A scaffold was erected in a public square; the old woman mounted
          it, and two mock executioners proceeded, amid a storm of huzzas and
          hand-clapping, to saw through her neck or rather through a bladder
          of blood which had been previously fitted to her neck. The blood
          gushed out and the old woman pretended to swoon and die. The last
          of these mock executions took place in 1737.<a id="noteref_864"
          name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> At
          Florence, during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Old
          Woman was represented by a figure stuffed with walnuts and dried
          figs and fastened to the top of a ladder. At Mid-Lent this effigy
          was sawn through the middle under the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Loggie</span></span> of the Mercato Nuovo, and
          as the dried fruits tumbled out they were scrambled for by the
          crowd. A trace of the custom is still to be seen in the practice,
          observed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg
          262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          by urchins, of secretly pinning paper ladders to the shoulders of
          women of the lower classes who happen to show themselves in the
          streets on the morning of Mid-Lent.<a id="noteref_865" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a> A
          similar custom is observed by urchins in Rome; and at Naples on the
          1st of April boys cut strips of cloth into the shape of saws, smear
          them with gypsum, and strike passers-by with their <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“saws”</span> on the back, thus imprinting the figure
          of a saw upon their clothes.<a id="noteref_866" name="noteref_866"
          href="#note_866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a> At
          Montalto in Calabria boys go about at Mid-Lent with little saws
          made of cane and jeer at old people, who therefore generally stay
          indoors on that day. The Calabrian women meet together at this time
          and feast on figs, chestnuts, honey, etc.; this they call
          <span class="tei tei-q">“sawing the Old Woman”</span>—a
          reminiscence probably of a custom like the old Florentine
          one.<a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href=
          "#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Barcelona on
          the day in question boys run about the streets, some with saws,
          others with billets of wood, others again with cloths in which they
          collect gratuities. They sing a song in which it is said that they
          are looking for the oldest woman of the city for the purpose of
          sawing her in two in honour of Mid-Lent; at last, pretending to
          have found her, they saw something in two and burn it. A like
          custom is found amongst the South Slavs. In Lent the Croats tell
          their children that at noon an old woman is being sawn in two
          outside the gates; and in Carniola also the saying is current that
          at Mid-Lent an old woman is taken out of the village and sawn in
          two. The North Slavonian expression for keeping Mid-Lent is
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bábu
          rezati</span></span>, that is, <span class="tei tei-q">“sawing the

          the following ceremonies it is plainly enacted. In some parts of
          Bohemia the effigy of Death is buried at sunset; then the girls go
          out into the wood and cut down a young tree with a green crown,
          hang a doll dressed as a woman on it, deck the whole with green,
          red, and white ribbons, and march in procession with their

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Eisenach on
          the Fourth Sunday in Lent young people used to fasten a straw-man,
          representing Death, to a wheel, which they trundled to the top of a
          hill. Then setting fire to the figure they allowed it and the wheel
          to roll downhill. Next they cut a tall fir-tree, tricked it out
          with ribbons, and set it up in the plain. The men then climbed the
          tree to fetch down the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg
          264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          ribbons.<a id="noteref_871" name="noteref_871" href=
          "#note_871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">871</span></span></a> In
          Upper Lusatia the figure of Death, made of straw and rags, is
          dressed in a veil furnished by the last bride and a shirt furnished
          by the house in which the last death occurred. Thus arrayed the
          figure is stuck on the end of a long pole and carried at full speed
          by the tallest and strongest girl, while the rest pelt the effigy
          with sticks and stones. Whoever hits it will be sure to live
          through the year. In this way Death is carried out of the village
          and thrown into the water or over the boundary of the next village.
          On their way home each one breaks a green branch and carries it
          gaily with him till he reaches the village, when he throws it away.
          Sometimes the young people of the next village, upon whose land the
          figure has been thrown, run after them and hurl it back, not
          wishing to have Death among them. Hence the two parties
          occasionally come to blows.<a id="noteref_872" name="noteref_872"
          href="#note_872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">872</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these cases
          Death is represented by the puppet which is thrown away, Summer or
          Life by the branches or trees which are brought back. But sometimes
          a new potency of life seems to be attributed to the image of Death
          itself, and by a kind of resurrection it becomes the instrument of
          the general revival. Thus in some parts of Lusatia women alone are
          concerned in carrying out Death, and suffer no male to meddle with
          it. Attired in mourning, which they wear the whole day, they make a
          puppet of straw, clothe it in a white shirt, and give it a broom in
          one hand and a scythe in the other. Singing songs and pursued by
          urchins throwing stones, they carry the puppet to the village
          boundary, where they tear it in pieces. Then they cut down
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name=
          "Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a fine tree, hang
          the shirt on it, and carry it home singing.<a id="noteref_873"
          name="noteref_873" href="#note_873"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">873</span></span></a> On
          the Feast of Ascension the Saxons of a village near Hermanstadt
          (Transylvania) observe the ceremony of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“carrying out Death”</span> in the following manner.
          After forenoon church all the school-girls repair to the house of
          one of their number, and there dress up the Death. This is done by
          tying a threshed-out corn-sheaf into the rough semblance of a head
          and body, while the arms are simulated by a broomstick stuck
          horizontally. The figure is dressed in the Sunday clothes of a
          village matron. It is then displayed at the window that all people
          may see it on their way to afternoon church. As soon as vespers are
          over the girls seize the effigy and, singing a hymn, carry it in
          procession round the village. Boys are excluded from the
          procession. After the procession has traversed the village from end
          to end, the figure is taken to another house and stripped of its
          attire; the naked straw bundle is then thrown out of the window to
          the boys, who carry it off and fling it into the nearest stream.
          This is the first act of the drama. In the second, one of the girls
          is solemnly invested with the clothes and ornaments previously worn
          by the figure of Death, and, like it, is led in procession round
          the village to the singing of the same hymns as before. The
          ceremony ends with a feast at the house of the girl who acted the
          chief part; as before, the boys are excluded. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“According to popular belief, it is allowed to eat
          fruit only after this day, as now the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Death,’</span> that is, the unwholesomeness—has been
          expelled from them. Also the river in which the Death has been
          drowned may now be considered fit for public bathing. If this
          ceremony be neglected in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> village where it is customary, such neglect
          is supposed to entail death to one of the young people, or loss of
          virtue to a girl.”</span><a id="noteref_874" name="noteref_874"
          href="#note_874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">874</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first of
          these two ceremonies the tree which is brought home after the
          destruction of the figure of Death is plainly equivalent to the
          trees or branches which, in the preceding customs, were brought
          back as representatives of Summer or Life, after Death had been
          thrown away or destroyed. But the transference of the shirt worn by
          the effigy of Death to the tree clearly indicates that the tree is
          a kind of revivification, in a new form, of the destroyed
          effigy.<a id="noteref_875" name="noteref_875" href=
          "#note_875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">875</span></span></a> This
          comes out also in the Transylvanian custom; the dressing of a girl
          in the clothes worn by the Death, and the leading her about the
          village to the same songs which had been sung when the Death was
          being carried about, show that she is intended to be a kind of
          resuscitation of the being whose effigy has just been destroyed.
          These examples therefore suggest that the Death whose demolition is
          represented in these ceremonies cannot be regarded as the purely
          destructive agent which we understand by Death. If the tree which
          is brought back as an embodiment of the reviving vegetation of
          spring is clothed in the shirt worn by the Death which has been
          just destroyed, the object certainly cannot be to check and
          counteract the revival of vegetation; it can only be to foster and
          promote it. Therefore the being which has just been destroyed—the
          so-called Death—must be supposed to be endowed with a vivifying and
          quickening influence, which it can communicate to the vegetable and
          even the animal world. This ascription of a life-giving virtue to
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name=
          "Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> figure of Death is
          put beyond a doubt by the custom, observed in some places, of
          taking pieces of the straw effigy of Death and placing them in the
          fields to make the crops grow, or in the manger to make the cattle
          thrive. Thus in Spachendorf (Austrian Silesia) the figure of Death
          made of straw, brushwood, and rags, is carried out with wild songs
          to an open place outside the village and there burned, and while it
          is burning a general struggle takes place for the pieces, which are
          pulled out of the flames with bare hands. Each one who secures a
          fragment of the effigy ties it to a branch of the largest tree in
          his garden, or buries it in his field, in the belief that this
          causes the crops to grow better.<a id="noteref_876" name=
          "noteref_876" href="#note_876"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">876</span></span></a> In
          the Troppau district (Austrian Silesia) the straw figure which the
          boys make on the Fourth Sunday in Lent is dressed by the girls in
          woman's clothes and hung with ribbons, necklace, and garlands.
          Attached to a long pole it is carried out of the village, followed
          by a troop of young people of both sexes, who alternately frolic,
          lament, and sing songs. Arrived at its destination—a field outside
          the village—the figure is stripped of its clothes and ornaments;
          then the crowd rushes on it and tears it to bits, scuffling for the
          fragments. Every one tries to get a wisp of the straw of which the
          effigy was made, because such a wisp, placed in the manger, is
          believed to make the cattle thrive.<a id="noteref_877" name=
          "noteref_877" href="#note_877"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">877</span></span></a> Or
          the straw is put in the hens' nest, it being supposed that this
          prevents the hens from carrying away their eggs, and makes them
          brood much better.<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878" href=
          "#note_878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a> The
          same attribution of a fertilising power to the figure of Death
          appears in the belief that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> if the bearers of the figure, after throwing
          it away, meet cattle and strike them with their sticks, this will
          render the cattle prolific.<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879"
          href="#note_879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a>
          Perhaps the sticks had been previously used to beat the
          Death,<a id="noteref_880" name="noteref_880" href=
          "#note_880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">880</span></span></a> and
          so had acquired the fertilising power ascribed to the effigy. In
          Leipzig at Mid-Lent men and women of the lowest class used to carry
          through all the streets a straw effigy of Death, which they
          exhibited to young wives, and finally threw into the river,
          alleging that this made young wives fruitful, cleansed the city,
          and averted the plague and other sickness from the inhabitants for
          that year.<a id="noteref_881" name="noteref_881" href=
          "#note_881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">881</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems hardly
          possible to separate from the May-trees the trees or branches which
          are brought into the village after the destruction of the Death.
          The bearers who bring them in profess to be bringing in the
          Summer;<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882" href=
          "#note_882"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">882</span></span></a>
          therefore the trees obviously represent the Summer; and the doll
          which is sometimes attached to the Summer-tree is a duplicate
          representative of the Summer, just as the May is sometimes
          represented at the same time by a May-tree and a May Lady.<a id=
          "noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href="#note_883"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a>
          Further, the Summer-trees are adorned like May-trees with ribbons,
          etc.; like May-trees, when large, they are planted in the ground
          and climbed up; and like May-trees, when small, they are carried
          from door to door by boys or girls singing songs and collecting
          money.<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href=
          "#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a> And
          as if to demonstrate the identity of the two sets of customs the
          bearers of the Summer-tree sometimes announce that they are
          bringing in the Summer <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg
          269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and the May.<a id="noteref_885" name="noteref_885" href=
          "#note_885"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a> The
          customs, therefore, of bringing in the May and bringing in the
          Summer are essentially the same; and the Summer-tree is merely
          another form of the May-tree, the only distinction (besides that of
          name) being in the time at which they are respectively brought in;
          for while the May-tree is usually fetched in on the 1st of May or
          at Whitsuntide, the Summer-tree is fetched in on the Fourth Sunday
          in Lent. Therefore, if the explanation here adopted of the May-tree
          (namely, that it is an embodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit of
          vegetation) is correct, the Summer-tree must likewise be an
          embodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. But we have
          seen that the Summer-tree is in some cases a revivification of the
          effigy of Death. It follows, therefore, that in these cases the
          effigy called Death must be an embodiment of the tree-spirit or
          spirit of vegetation. This inference is confirmed, first, by the
          vivifying and fertilising influence which the fragments of the
          effigy of Death are believed to exercise both on vegetable and on
          animal life;<a id="noteref_886" name="noteref_886" href=
          "#note_886"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a> for
          this influence, as we saw in the first chapter, is supposed to be a
          special attribute of the tree-spirit. It is confirmed, secondly, by
          observing that the effigy of Death is sometimes composed of birchen
          twigs, of the branch of a beech-tree, of a threshed-out corn-sheaf,
          or of hemp;<a id="noteref_887" name="noteref_887" href=
          "#note_887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">887</span></span></a> and
          that sometimes it is hung on a little tree and so carried about by
          girls collecting money,<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href=
          "#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a> just
          as is done with the May-tree and the May Lady, and with the
          Summer-tree and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg
          270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          doll attached to it. In short we are driven to regard the expulsion
          of Death and the bringing in of Summer as, in some cases at least,
          merely another form of that death and resuscitation of the spirit
          of vegetation in spring which we saw enacted in the killing and
          resurrection of the Wild Man.<a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889"
          href="#note_889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a> The
          burial and resurrection of the Carnival is probably another way of
          expressing the same idea. The burying of the representative of the
          Carnival under a dung-heap is natural, if he is supposed to possess
          a quickening and fertilising influence like that ascribed to the
          effigy of Death. By the Esthonians, indeed, the straw figure which
          is carried out of the village in the usual way on Shrove Tuesday is
          not called the Carnival, but the Wood-spirit (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Metsik</span></span>), and the identity of it
          with the wood-spirit is further shown by fixing it to the top of a
          tree in the wood, where it remains for a year, and is besought
          almost daily with prayers and offerings to protect the herds; for
          like a true wood-spirit the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Metsik</span></span> is a patron of cattle.
          Sometimes the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Metsik</span></span> is made of sheafs of
          corn.<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href=
          "#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a>
          Therefore, we may fairly conjecture that the names Carnival, Death,
          and Summer, are comparatively late and inadequate expressions for
          the beings personified or embodied in the customs described. The
          very abstractness of the names bespeaks a modern origin; the
          personification of times and seasons like the Carnival and Summer,
          or of an abstract notion like death, is hardly primitive. But the
          ceremonies themselves bear the stamp of a dateless antiquity;
          therefore we can hardly help supposing that in their origin the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name=
          "Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ideas which they
          embodied were of a more simple and concrete order. The conception
          of a tree, perhaps of a particular kind of tree (for some savages
          have no word for tree in general), or even of an individual tree,
          is sufficiently concrete to supply a basis from which by a gradual
          process of generalisation the wider conception of a spirit of
          vegetation might be reached. But this general conception of
          vegetation would readily be confounded with the season in which it
          manifests itself; hence the substitution of Spring, Summer, or May
          for the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation would be easy and
          natural. Again the concrete notion of the dying tree or dying
          vegetation would by a similar process of generalisation glide into
          a notion of death in general; so that instead of the carrying out
          of the dying or dead vegetation in spring (as a preliminary to its
          revival) we should in time get a carrying out of Death itself. The
          view that in these spring ceremonies Death meant originally the
          dying or dead vegetation of winter has the high support of W.
          Mannhardt; and he confirms it by the analogy of the name Death as
          applied to the spirit of the ripe corn. Commonly the spirit of the
          ripe corn is conceived, not as dead, but as old, and hence it goes
          by the name of the Old Man or the Old Woman. But in some places the
          last sheaf cut at harvest, which is generally believed to be the
          seat of the corn spirit, is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Dead One;”</span> children are warned against entering the
          corn-fields because Death sits in the corn; and, in a game played
          by Saxon children in Transylvania at the maize harvest, Death is
          represented by a child completely covered with maize leaves.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The supposition
          that behind the conceptions of Death, Carnival, Summer, etc., as
          embodied in these spring ceremonies, there lurk older and more
          concrete notions is to a certain extent countenanced by the fact
          that in Russia funeral ceremonies like those of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Burying the Carnival”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Carrying out Death”</span> are celebrated under the
          names, not of Death or the Carnival, but of certain mythic figures,
          Kostrubonko, Kostroma, Kupalo, Lada, and Yarilo. These Russian
          ceremonies are observed both in spring and at midsummer. Thus
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in Little Russia it used to be the custom
          at Eastertide to celebrate the funeral of a being called
          Kostrubonko, the deity of the spring. A circle was formed of
          singers who moved slowly around a girl who lay on the ground as if
          dead, and as they went they sang—</span></p>

          be represented as follows. A bonfire was kindled on the 28th of
          June, and on the next day the maidens chose one of their number to
          play the part of Kostroma. Her companions saluted her with deep
          obeisances, placed her on a board, and carried her to the bank of a
          stream. There they bathed her in the water, while the oldest girl
          made a basket of lime-tree bark and beat it like a drum. Then they
          returned to the village and ended the day with processions, games,
          and dances.<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href=

          the Murom district, Kostroma was represented by a straw figure
          dressed in woman's clothes and flowers. This was laid in a trough
          and carried with songs to the bank of a lake or river. Here the
          crowd divided into two sides, of which the one attacked and the
          other defended the figure. At last the assailants gained the day,
          stripped the figure of its dress and ornaments, tore it in pieces,
          trod the straw of which it was made under foot, and flung it into
          the stream; while the defenders of the figure hid their faces in
          their hands and pretended to bewail the death of Kostroma.<a id=

          the district of Kostroma the burial of Yarilo was celebrated on the
          29th or 30th of June. The people chose an old man and gave him a
          small coffin containing a Priapus-like figure representing Yarilo.
          This he carried out of the town, followed by women chanting
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name=
          "Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dirges and
          expressing by their gestures grief and despair. In the open fields
          a grave was dug, and into it the figure was lowered amid weeping
          and wailing, after which games and dances were begun, <span class=

          Little Russia the figure of Yarilo was laid in a coffin and carried
          through the streets after sunset surrounded by drunken women, who
          kept repeating mournfully, <span class="tei tei-q">“He is dead! he
          is dead!”</span> The men lifted and shook the figure as if they
          were trying to recall the dead man to life. Then they said to the
          women, <span class="tei tei-q">“Women, weep not. I know what is
          sweeter than honey.”</span> But the women continued to lament and
          chant, as they do at funerals. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of what was
          he guilty? He was so good. He will arise no more. O how shall we
          part from thee? What is life without thee? Arise, if only for a
          brief hour. But he rises not, he rises not.”</span> At last the
          Yarilo was buried in a grave.<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These Russian
          customs are plainly of the same nature as those which in Austria
          and Germany are known as <span class="tei tei-q">“Burying the
          Carnival”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Carrying out
          Death.”</span> Therefore if my interpretation of the latter is
          right, the Russian Kostroma, Yarilo, etc. must also have been
          originally embodiments of the spirit of vegetation, and their death
          must have been regarded as a necessary preliminary to their
          revival. The revival as a sequel to the death is enacted in the
          first of the ceremonies described, the death and resurrection of
          Kostrubonko. The reason why in some of these Russian ceremonies the
          death of the spirit of vegetation is celebrated at midsummer may
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name=
          "Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be that the decline
          of summer is dated from Midsummer Day, after which the days begin
          to shorten, and the sun sets out on his downward journey—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a
          turning-point of the year, when vegetation might be thought to
          share the incipient though still almost imperceptible decay of
          summer, might very well be chosen by primitive man as a fit moment
          for resorting to those magic ceremonies by which he hopes to stay
          the decline, or at least to ensure the revival, of plant life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
          death of vegetation appears to have been represented in all, and
          its revival in some, of these spring and midsummer ceremonies,
          there are features in some of them which can hardly be explained on
          this hypothesis alone. The solemn funeral, the lamentations, and
          the mourning attire, which often characterise these ceremonies, are
          indeed appropriate at the death of the beneficent spirit of
          vegetation. But what shall we say of the glee with which the effigy
          is often carried out, of the sticks and stones with which it is
          assailed, and the taunts and curses which are hurled at it? What
          shall we say of the dread of the effigy evinced by the haste with
          which the bearers scamper home as soon as they have thrown it away,
          and by the belief that some one must soon die in any house into
          which it has looked? This dread might perhaps be explained by a
          belief that there is a certain infectiousness in the dead spirit of
          vegetation which renders its approach dangerous. But this
          explanation, besides being rather strained, does not cover the
          rejoicings which often attend the carrying out of
          Death.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg
          276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must
          therefore recognise two distinct and seemingly opposite features in
          these ceremonies; on the one hand, sorrow for the death, and
          affection and respect for the dead; on the other hand, fear and
          hatred of the dead, and rejoicings at his death. How the former of
          these features is to be explained I have attempted to show; how the
          latter came to be so closely associated with the former is a
          question which I shall try to answer in the sequel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before we quit
          these European customs to go farther afield, it will be well to
          notice that occasionally the expulsion of Death or of a mythic
          being is conducted without any visible representative of the
          personage expelled. Thus at Königshain, near Görlitz (Silesia), all
          the villagers, young and old, used to go out with straw torches to
          the top of a neighbouring hill, called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Todtenstein</span></span> (Death-stone), where
          they lit their torches, and so returned home singing, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We have driven out Death, we are bringing back
          Summer.”</span><a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a> In
          Albania young people light torches of resinous wood on Easter Eve,
          and march in procession through the village brandishing them. At
          last they throw the torches into the river, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ha, Kore, we fling you into the river, like these
          torches, that you may return no more.”</span> Some say that the
          intention of the ceremony is to drive out winter; but Kore is
          conceived as a malignant being who devours children.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Kânagrâ
          district, India, there is a custom observed by young girls in
          spring which closely resembles some of the European spring
          ceremonies just described. It is called the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ralî Ka
          melâ</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg
          277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fair of Rali, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ralî</span></span> being a small painted
          earthen image of Siva or Pârvatî. It lasts through most of Chet
          (March-April) up to the Sankrânt of Baisâkh (April), and is in
          vogue all over the Kânagrâ district. Its celebration is entirely
          confined to young girls. On a morning in March all the young girls
          of the village take small baskets of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">dûb</span></span> grass and flowers to a
          certain fixed spot, where they throw them in a heap. Round this
          heap they stand in a circle and sing. This goes on every day for
          ten days, till the heap of grass and flowers has reached a fair
          height. Then they cut in the jungle two branches having three
          prongs at one end, and place them, prongs downwards, over the heap
          of flowers, so as to make two tripods or pyramids. On the single
          uppermost points of these branches they get an image-maker to
          construct two clay images, one to represent Siva, and the other
          Pârvatî. The girls then divide themselves into two parties, one for
          Siva and one for Pârvatî, and marry the images in the usual way,
          leaving out no part of the ceremony. After the marriage they have a
          feast, the cost of which is defrayed by contributions solicited
          from their parents. Then at the next Sankrânt (Baisâkh) they all go
          together to the riverside, throw the images into a deep pool, and
          weep over the place, as though they were performing funeral
          obsequies. The boys of the neighbourhood often annoy them by diving
          after the images, bringing them up, and waving them about while the
          girls are crying over them. The object of the fair is said to be to
          secure a good husband.<a id="noteref_900" name="noteref_900" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That in this
          Indian ceremony the deities Siva and Pârvatî are conceived as
          spirits of vegetation seems to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> be proved by the fact that their images are
          placed on branches over a heap of grass and flowers. Here, as often
          in European folk-custom, the divinities of vegetation are
          represented in duplicate, by plants and by puppets. The marriage of
          these Indian deities in spring corresponds to the European
          ceremonies in which the marriage of the vernal spirits of
          vegetation is represented by the King and Queen of May, the May
          Bride, Bridegroom of the May, etc.<a id="noteref_901" name=

          throwing of the images into the water, and the mourning for them,
          are the equivalents of the European customs of throwing the dead
          spirit of vegetation (under the name of Death, Yarilo, Kostroma,
          etc.) into the water and lamenting over it. Again, in India, as
          often in Europe, the rite is performed exclusively by females. The
          notion that the ceremony was effective for procuring husbands to
          the girls can be explained by the quickening and fertilising
          influence which the spirit of vegetation is believed to exert upon

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is in
          Egypt and Western Asia that the death and resurrection of
          vegetation appear to have been most widely celebrated with
          ceremonies like those of modern Europe. Under the names of Osiris,
          Adonis, Thammuz, Attis, and Dionysus, the Egyptians, Syrians,
          Babylonians, Phrygians, and Greeks represented the decay and
          revival of vegetation with rites which, as the ancients themselves
          recognised, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg
          279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          were substantially the same, and which find their parallels in the
          spring and midsummer customs of our European peasantry. The nature
          and worship of these deities have been discussed at length by many
          learned writers; all that I propose to do is to sketch those
          salient features in their ritual and legends which seem to
          establish the view here taken of their nature. We begin with Adonis
          or Thammuz.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The worship of
          Adonis was practised by the Semitic peoples of Syria, from whom it
          was borrowed by the Greeks as early at least as the fifth century
          before Christ. The name Adonis is the Phoenician <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Adon</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lord.”</span><a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903"
          href="#note_903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a> He
          was said to have been a fair youth, beloved by Aphrodite (the
          Semitic Astarte), but slain by a boar in his youthful prime. His
          death was annually lamented with a bitter wailing, chiefly by
          women; images of him, dressed to resemble corpses, were carried out
          as to burial and then thrown into the sea or into springs;<a id=
          "noteref_904" name="noteref_904" href="#note_904"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">904</span></span></a> and
          in some places his revival was celebrated on the following
          day.<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href=
          "#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a> But
          the ceremonies varied somewhat both in the manner and the season of
          their celebration in different places. At Alexandria images of
          Adonis and Aphrodite were displayed on two couches; beside them
          were set ripe fruits of all kinds, cakes, plants growing in flower
          pots, and green bowers twined with anise. The marriage of the
          lovers was celebrated one day, and on the next the image of Adonis
          was borne by women attired as mourners, with streaming hair and
          bared breasts, to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
          280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the sea-shore and committed to the waves.<a id="noteref_906" name=
          "noteref_906" href="#note_906"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">906</span></span></a> The
          date at which this Alexandrian ceremony was observed is not
          expressly stated; but from the mention of the ripe fruits it has
          been inferred that it took place in late summer.<a id="noteref_907"
          name="noteref_907" href="#note_907"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">907</span></span></a> At
          Byblus the death of Adonis was annually mourned with weeping,
          wailing, and beating of the breast; but next day he was believed to
          come to life again and ascend up to heaven in the presence of his
          worshippers.<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href=
          "#note_908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a> This
          celebration appears to have taken place in spring; for its date was
          determined by the discoloration of the river Adonis, and this has
          been observed by modern travellers to occur in spring. At that
          season the red earth washed down from the mountains by the rain
          tinges the water of the river and even the sea for a great way with
          a blood-red hue, and the crimson stain was believed to be the blood
          of Adonis, annually wounded to death by the boar on Mount
          Lebanon.<a id="noteref_909" name="noteref_909" href=
          "#note_909"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Again, the red anemone<a id="noteref_910" name="noteref_910" href=
          "#note_910"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">910</span></span></a> was
          said to have sprung from the blood of Adonis; and as the anemone
          blooms in Syria about Easter, this is a fresh proof that the
          festival of Adonis, or at least one of his festivals, was
          celebrated in spring. The name of the flower is probably derived
          from Naaman (<span class="tei tei-q">“darling”</span>), which seems
          to have been an epithet of Adonis. The Arabs still call the anemone
          <span class="tei tei-q">“wounds of the Naaman.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href="#note_911"><span class=

          id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The resemblance
          of these ceremonies to the Indian and European ceremonies
          previously described is obvious. In particular, apart from the
          somewhat doubtful date of its celebration, the Alexandrian ceremony
          is almost identical with the Indian. In both of them the marriage
          of two divinities, whose connection with vegetation seems indicated
          by the fresh plants with which they are surrounded, is celebrated
          in effigy, and the effigies are afterwards mourned over and thrown
          into the water.<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912" href=
          "#note_912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a> From
          the similarity of these customs to each other and to the spring and
          midsummer customs of modern Europe we should naturally expect that
          they all admit of a common explanation. Hence, if the explanation
          here adopted of the latter is correct, the ceremony of the death
          and resurrection of Adonis must also have been a representation of
          the decay and revival of vegetation. The inference thus based on
          the similarity of the customs is confirmed by the following
          features in the legend and ritual of Adonis. His connection with
          vegetation comes out at once in the common story of his birth. He
          was said to have been born from a myrrh-tree, the bark of which
          bursting, after a ten months' gestation, allowed the lovely infant
          to come forth. According to some, a boar rent the bark with his
          tusk and so opened a passage for the babe. A faint rationalistic
          colour was given to the legend by saying that his mother was a
          woman named Myrrh, who had been turned into a myrrh-tree soon after
          she had conceived the child.<a id="noteref_913" name="noteref_913"
          href="#note_913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a> Again
          the story that Adonis <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg
          282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          spent half, or according to others a third, of the year in the
          lower world and the rest of it in the upper world,<a id=
          "noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href="#note_914"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a> is
          explained most simply and naturally by supposing that he
          represented vegetation, especially the corn, which lies buried in
          the earth half the year and reappears above ground the other half.
          Certainly of the annual phenomena of nature there is none which
          suggests so obviously the idea of a yearly death and resurrection
          as the disappearance and reappearance of vegetation in autumn and
          spring. Adonis has been taken for the sun; but there is nothing in
          the sun's annual course within the temperate and tropical zones to
          suggest that he is dead for half or a third of the year and alive
          for the other half or two-thirds. He might, indeed, be conceived as
          weakened in winter,<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href=
          "#note_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a> but
          dead he could not be thought to be; his daily reappearance
          contradicts the supposition. Within the arctic circle, where the
          sun annually disappears for a continuous period of from twenty-four
          hours to six months, according to the latitude, his annual death
          and resurrection would certainly be an obvious idea; but no one has
          suggested that the Adonis worship came from those regions. On the
          other hand the annual death and revival of vegetation is a
          conception which readily presents itself to men in every stage of
          savagery and civilisation; and the vastness of the scale on which
          this yearly decay and regeneration <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> takes place, together with man's intimate
          dependence on it for subsistence, combine to render it the most
          striking annual phenomenon in nature, at least within the temperate
          zones. It is no wonder that a phenomenon so important, so striking,
          and so universal should, by suggesting similar ideas, have given
          rise to similar rites in many lands. We may, therefore, accept as
          probable an explanation of the Adonis worship which accords so well
          with the facts of nature and with the analogy of similar rites in
          other lands, and which besides is countenanced by a considerable
          body of opinion amongst the ancients themselves.<a id="noteref_916"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The character of
          Thammuz or Adonis as a corn-spirit comes out plainly in an account
          of his festival given by an Arabic writer of the tenth century. In
          describing the rites and sacrifices observed at the different
          seasons of the year by the heathen Syrians of Harran, he
          says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Thammuz (July). In the middle of
          this month is the festival of el-Bûgât, that is, of the weeping
          women, and this is the Tâ-uz festival, which is celebrated in
          honour of the god Tâ-uz. The women bewail him, because his lord
          slew him so cruelly, ground his bones in a mill, and then scattered
          them to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg
          284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the wind. The women (during this festival) eat nothing which has
          been ground in a mill, but limit their diet to steeped wheat, sweet
          vetches, dates, raisins, and the like.”</span><a id="noteref_917"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But perhaps the
          best proof that Adonis was a deity of vegetation is furnished by
          the gardens of Adonis, as they were called. These were baskets or
          pots filled with earth, in which wheat, barley, lettuces, fennel,
          and various kinds of flowers were sown and tended for eight days,
          chiefly or exclusively by women. Fostered by the sun's heat, the
          plants shot up rapidly, but having no root withered as rapidly
          away, and at the end of eight days were carried out with the images
          of the dead Adonis, and flung with them into the sea or into
          springs.<a id="noteref_919" name="noteref_919" href=
          "#note_919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">919</span></span></a> At
          Athens these ceremonies were observed at midsummer. For we know
          that the fleet which Athens fitted out against Syracuse, and by the
          destruction of which her power was permanently crippled, sailed at
          midsummer, and by an ominous coincidence the sombre rites of Adonis
          were being celebrated at the very time. As the troops marched down
          to the harbour to embark, the streets through which they
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name=
          "Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> passed were lined
          with coffins and corpse-like effigies, and the air was rent with
          the noise of women wailing for the dead Adonis. The circumstance
          cast a gloom over the sailing of the most splendid armament that
          Athens ever sent to sea.<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920"
          href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These gardens of
          Adonis are most naturally interpreted as representatives of Adonis
          or manifestations of his power; they represented him, true to his
          original nature, in vegetable form, while the images of him, with
          which they were carried out and cast into the water, represented
          him in his later anthropomorphic form. All these Adonis ceremonies,
          if I am right, were originally intended as charms to promote the
          growth and revival of vegetation; and the principle by which they
          were supposed to produce this effect was sympathetic magic. As was
          explained in the first chapter, primitive people suppose that by
          representing or mimicking the effect which they desire to produce
          they actually help to produce it; thus by sprinkling water they
          make rain, by lighting a fire they make sunshine, and so on.
          Similarly by mimicking the growth of crops, they hope to insure a
          good harvest. The rapid growth of the wheat and barley in the
          gardens of Adonis was intended to make the corn shoot up; and the
          throwing of the gardens and of the images into the water was a
          charm to secure a due supply of fertilising rain.<a id=
          "noteref_921" name="noteref_921" href="#note_921"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">921</span></span></a> The
          same, I take it, was the object of throwing the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> effigies of Death and the Carnival into
          water in the corresponding ceremonies of modern Europe. We have
          seen that the custom of drenching a leaf-clad person (who
          undoubtedly personifies vegetation) with water is still resorted to
          in Europe for the express purpose of producing rain.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a>
          Similarly the custom of throwing water on the last corn cut at
          harvest, or on the person who brings it home (a custom observed in
          Germany and France, and till quite lately in England and Scotland),
          is in some places practised with the avowed intent to procure rain
          for the next year's crops. Thus in Wallachia and amongst the
          Roumanians of Transylvania, when a girl is bringing home a crown
          made of the last ears of corn cut at harvest, all who meet her
          hasten to throw water on her, and two farm-servants are placed at
          the door for the purpose; for they believe that if this were not
          done, the crops next year would perish from drought.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">923</span></span></a> So
          amongst the Saxons of Transylvania, the person who wears the wreath
          made of the last corn cut (sometimes the reaper who cut the last
          corn also wears the wreath) is drenched with water to the skin; for
          the wetter he is the better will be next year's harvest, and the
          more grain there will be threshed out.<a id="noteref_924" name=

          the spring ploughing in Prussia, when the ploughmen and sowers
          returned in the evening from their work in the fields, the farmer's
          wife and the servants used to splash water over them. The ploughmen
          and sowers retorted by seizing every one, throwing them into the
          pond, and ducking them under the water. The <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> farmer's wife might claim exemption on
          payment of a forfeit; but every one else had to be ducked. By
          observing this custom they hoped to ensure a due supply of rain for
          the seed.<a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href=

          after harvest in Prussia, the person who wore a wreath made of the
          last corn cut was drenched with water, while a prayer was uttered
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“as the corn had sprung up and
          multiplied through the water, so it might spring up and multiply in
          the barn and granary.”</span><a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926"

          Babylonian legend, the goddess Istar (Astarte, Aphrodite) descends
          to Hades to fetch the water of life with which to restore to life
          the dead Thammuz, and it appears that the water was thrown over him
          at a great mourning ceremony, at which men and women stood round
          the funeral pyre of Thammuz lamenting.<a id="noteref_927" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a> This
          legend, as Mannhardt points out, is probably a mythical explanation
          of a Babylonian festival resembling the Syrian festival of Adonis.
          At this festival, which doubtless took place in the month Thammuz
          (June-July)<a id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928" href=
          "#note_928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a> and
          therefore about midsummer, the dead Thammuz was probably
          represented in effigy, water was poured over him, and he came to
          life again. This Babylonian legend is, therefore, of importance,
          since it confirms the view that the purpose for which the images
          and gardens of Adonis were thrown into the water was to effect the
          resurrection of the god, that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is, to secure the revival of vegetation. The
          connection of Thammuz with vegetation is proved by a fragment of a
          Babylonian hymn, in which Thammuz is described as dwelling in the
          midst of a great tree at the centre of the earth.<a id=
          "noteref_929" name="noteref_929" href="#note_929"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The opinion that
          the gardens of Adonis are essentially charms to promote the growth
          of vegetation, especially of the crops, and that they belong to the
          same class of customs as those spring and midsummer folk-customs of
          modern Europe which have been described, does not rest for its
          evidence merely on the intrinsic probability of the case.
          Fortunately, we are able to show that gardens of Adonis (if we may
          use the expression in a general sense) are still planted, first, by
          a primitive race at their sowing season, and, second, by European
          peasants at midsummer. Amongst the Oraons and Mundas of Bengal,
          when the time comes for planting out the rice which has been grown
          in seed-beds, a party of young people of both sexes go to the
          forest and cut a young Karma tree, or the branch of one. Bearing it
          in triumph they return dancing, singing, and beating drums, and
          plant it in the middle of the village dancing-ground. A sacrifice
          is offered to the tree; and next morning the youth of both sexes,
          linked arm-in-arm, dance in a great circle round the Karma tree,
          which is decked with strips of coloured cloth and sham bracelets
          and necklets of plaited straw. As a preparation for the festival,
          the daughters of the head-man of the village cultivate blades of
          barley in a peculiar way. The seed is sown in moist, sandy soil,
          mixed with turmeric, and the blades sprout and unfold of a pale
          yellow or primrose colour. On the day of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the festival the girls take up these blades
          and carry them in baskets to the dancing-ground, where, prostrating
          themselves reverentially, they place some of the plants before the
          Karma tree. Finally, the Karma tree is taken away and thrown into a
          stream or tank.<a id="noteref_930" name="noteref_930" href=
          "#note_930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a> The
          meaning of planting these barley blades and then presenting them to
          the Karma tree is hardly open to question. We have seen that trees
          are supposed to exercise a quickening influence upon the growth of
          crops, and that amongst the very people in question—the Mundas or
          Mundaris—<span class="tei tei-q">“the grove deities are held
          responsible for the crops.”</span><a id="noteref_931" name=
          "noteref_931" href="#note_931"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">931</span></span></a>
          Therefore, when at the season for planting out the rice the Mundas
          bring in a tree and treat it with so much respect, their object can
          only be to foster thereby the growth of the rice which is about to
          be planted out; and the custom of causing barley blades to sprout
          rapidly and then presenting them to the tree must be intended to
          subserve the same purpose, perhaps by reminding the tree-spirit of
          his duty towards the crops, and stimulating his activity by this
          visible example of rapid vegetable growth. The throwing of the
          Karma tree into the water is to be interpreted as a rain-charm.
          Whether the barley blades are also thrown into the water is not
          said; but, if my interpretation of the custom is right, probably
          they are so. A distinction between this Bengal custom and the Greek
          rites of Adonis is that in the former the tree-spirit appears in
          his original form as a tree; whereas in the Adonis worship he
          appears in anthropomorphic form, represented as a dead man, though
          his vegetable nature is indicated by the gardens of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Adonis, which are, so to say, a
          secondary manifestation of his original power as a tree-spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Sardinia the
          gardens of Adonis are still planted in connection with the great
          midsummer festival which bears the name of St. John. At the end of
          March or on the 1st of April a young man of the village presents
          himself to a girl and asks her to be his <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">comare</span></span> (gossip or sweetheart),
          offering to be her <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">compare</span></span>. The invitation is
          considered as an honour by the girl's family, and is gladly
          accepted. At the end of May the girl makes a pot of the bark of the
          cork-tree, fills it with earth, and sows a handful of wheat and
          barley in it. The pot being placed in the sun and often watered,
          the corn sprouts rapidly and has a good head by Midsummer Eve (St.
          John's Eve, 23d June). The pot is then called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Erme</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nenneri</span></span>. On St. John's Day the
          young man and the girl, dressed in their best, accompanied by a
          long retinue and preceded by children gambolling and frolicking,
          move in procession to a church outside the village. Here they break
          the pot by throwing it against the door of the church. Then they
          sit down in a ring on the grass and eat eggs and herbs to the music
          of flutes. Wine is mixed in a cup and passed round, each one
          drinking as it passes. Then they join hands and sing <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sweethearts of St. John”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Compare e comare
          di San Giovanni</span></span>) over and over again, the flutes
          playing the while. When they tire of singing, they stand up and
          dance gaily in a ring till evening. This is the general Sardinian
          custom. As practised at Ozieri it has some special features. In May
          the pots are made of cork-bark and planted with corn, as already
          described. Then on the Eve of St. John the window-sills are draped
          with rich cloths, on which the pots are placed, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> adorned with crimson and blue silk and
          ribbons of various colours. On each of the pots they used formerly
          to place a statuette or cloth doll dressed as a woman, or a
          Priapus-like figure made of paste; but this custom, rigorously
          forbidden by the Church, has fallen into disuse. The village swains
          go about in a troop to look at the pots and their decorations and
          to wait for the girls, who assemble on the public square to
          celebrate the festival. Here a great bonfire is kindled, round
          which they dance and make merry. Those who wish to be <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sweethearts of St. John”</span> act as follows. The
          young man stands on one side of the bonfire and the girl on the
          other, and they, in a manner, join hands by each grasping one end
          of a long stick, which they pass three times backwards and forwards
          across the fire, thus thrusting their hands thrice rapidly into the
          flames. This seals their relationship to each other. Dancing and
          music go on till late at night.<a id="noteref_932" name=
          "noteref_932" href="#note_932"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">932</span></span></a> The
          correspondence of these Sardinian pots of grain to the gardens of
          Adonis seems complete, and the images formerly placed in them
          answer to the images of Adonis which accompanied his gardens.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Sardinian
          custom is one of those midsummer customs, once celebrated in many
          parts of Europe, a chief feature of which is the great bonfire
          round which people dance and over which they leap. Examples of
          these customs have already been cited from Sweden and
          Bohemia.<a id="noteref_933" name="noteref_933" href=
          "#note_933"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">933</span></span></a> These
          examples sufficiently <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
          292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          prove the connection of the midsummer bonfire with vegetation; for
          both in Sweden and Bohemia an essential part of the festival is the
          raising of a May-pole or Midsummer-tree, which in Bohemia is burned
          in the bonfire. Again, in the Russian midsummer ceremony cited
          above,<a id="noteref_934" name="noteref_934" href=
          "#note_934"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a> the
          straw figure of Kupalo, the representative of vegetation, is placed
          beside a May-pole or Midsummer-tree and then carried to and fro
          across a bonfire. Kupalo is here represented in duplicate, in
          tree-form by the Midsummer-tree, and in anthropomorphic form by the
          straw effigy, just as Adonis was represented both by an image and a
          garden of Adonis; and the duplicate representatives of Kupalo, like
          those of Adonis, are finally cast into water. In the Sardinian
          custom the Gossips or Sweethearts of St. John probably correspond
          to the Lord and Lady or King and Queen of May. In the province of
          Blekinge (Sweden), part of the midsummer festival is the election
          of a Midsummer Bride, who chooses her bridegroom; a collection is
          made for the pair, who for the time being are looked upon as man
          and wife.<a id="noteref_935" name="noteref_935" href=
          "#note_935"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">935</span></span></a> Such
          Midsummer pairs are probably, like the May pairs, representatives
          of the spirit of vegetation in its reproductive capacity; they
          represent in flesh and blood what the images of Siva and Pârvatî in
          the Indian ceremony, and the images of Adonis and Aphrodite in the
          Alexandrian ceremony, represented in effigy. The reason why
          ceremonies whose aim is to foster the growth of vegetation should
          thus be associated with bonfires; why in particular the
          representative of vegetation should be burned in tree-form or
          passed across the fire in effigy or in the form of a living couple,
          will be explained later on. Here <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> it is enough to have proved the fact of such
          association and therefore to have obviated the objection which
          might have been raised to my interpretation of the Sardinian
          custom, on the ground that the bonfires have nothing to do with
          vegetation. One more piece of evidence may here be given to prove
          the contrary. In some parts of Germany young men and girls leap
          over midsummer bonfires for the express purpose of making the hemp
          or flax grow tall.<a id="noteref_936" name="noteref_936" href=
          "#note_936"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">936</span></span></a> We
          may, therefore, assume that in the Sardinian custom the blades of
          wheat and barley which are forced on in pots for the midsummer
          festival, and which correspond so closely to the gardens of Adonis,
          form one of those widely-spread midsummer ceremonies, the original
          object of which was to promote the growth of vegetation, and
          especially of the crops. But as, by an easy extension of ideas, the
          spirit of vegetation was believed to exercise a beneficent
          influence over human as well as animal life, the gardens of Adonis
          would be supposed, like the May-trees or May-boughs, to bring good
          luck to the family or to the individual who planted them; and even
          after the idea had been abandoned that they operated actively to
          bring good luck, omens might still be drawn from them as to the
          good or bad fortune of families or individuals. It is thus that
          magic dwindles into divination. Accordingly we find modes of
          divination practised at midsummer which resemble more or less
          closely the gardens of Adonis. Thus an anonymous Italian writer of
          the sixteenth century has recorded that it was customary to sow
          barley and wheat a few days before the festival of St. John
          (Midsummer Day) and also before that of St. Vitus; and it was
          believed that the person for whom they were <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sown would be fortunate and get a good
          husband or a good wife, if the grain sprouted well; but if they
          sprouted ill, he or she would be unlucky.<a id="noteref_937" name=
          "noteref_937" href="#note_937"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">937</span></span></a> In
          various parts of Italy and all over Sicily it is still customary to
          put plants in water or in earth on the Eve of St. John, and from
          the manner in which they are found to be blooming or fading on St.
          John's Day omens are drawn, especially as to fortune in love.
          Amongst the plants used for this purpose are <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ciuri di S.
          Giuvanni</span></span> (St. John's wort?) and nettles.<a id=
          "noteref_938" name="noteref_938" href="#note_938"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">938</span></span></a> In
          Prussia two hundred years ago the farmers used to send out their
          servants, especially their maids, to gather St. John's wort on
          Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day (St. John's Day). When they had
          fetched it, the farmer took as many plants as there were persons
          and stuck them in the wall or between the beams; and it was thought
          that the person whose plant did not bloom would soon fall sick or
          die. The rest of the plants were tied in a bundle, fastened to the
          end of a pole, and set up at the gate or wherever the corn would be
          brought in at the next harvest. This bundle was called <span lang=
          "de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kupole</span></span>; the ceremony was known
          as Kupole's festival; and at it the farmer prayed for a good crop
          of hay, etc.<a id="noteref_939" name="noteref_939" href=
          "#note_939"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">939</span></span></a> This
          Prussian custom is particularly notable, inasmuch as it strongly
          confirms the opinion expressed above that Kupalo (doubtless
          identical with Kupole) was originally a deity of vegetation.<a id=
          "noteref_940" name="noteref_940" href="#note_940"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a> For
          here Kupalo is represented by a bundle <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of plants specially associated with midsummer
          in folk-custom; and her influence over vegetation is plainly
          signified by placing her plant-formed representative over the place
          where the harvest is brought in, as well as by the prayers for a
          good crop which are uttered on the occasion. A fresh argument is
          thus supplied in support of the conclusion that the Death, whose
          analogy to Kupalo, Yarilo, etc., has been shown, was originally a
          personification of vegetation, more especially of vegetation as
          dying or dead in winter. Further, my interpretation of the gardens
          of Adonis is confirmed by finding that in this Prussian custom the
          very same kind of plants are used to form the gardens of Adonis (as
          we may call them) and the image of the deity. Nothing could set in
          a stronger light the truth of the view that the gardens of Adonis
          are merely another manifestation of the god himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last example
          of the gardens of Adonis which I shall cite is the following. At
          the approach of Easter, Sicilian women sow wheat, lentils, and
          canary-seed in plates, which are kept in the dark and watered every
          two days. The plants soon shoot up; the stalks are tied together
          with red ribbons, and the plates containing them are placed on the
          sepulchres which, with effigies of the dead Christ, are made up in

          those gods, whose supposed death and resurrection struck such deep
          roots into the religious faith and ritual of Western Asia, is
          Attis. He was to Phrygia what Adonis was to Syria. Like Adonis, he
          appears to have been a god of vegetation, and his death and
          resurrection were annually mourned and rejoiced over at a festival
          in spring. The legends and rites of the two gods were so much alike
          that the ancients themselves sometimes identified them.<a id=

          was said to have been a fair youth who was beloved by the great
          Phrygian goddess Cybele. Two different accounts of his death were
          current. According to the one, he was killed by a boar, like
          Adonis. According to the other, he mutilated himself under a
          pine-tree, and died from the effusion of blood. The latter is said
          to have been the local story told by the people of Pessinus, a
          great centre of Cybele worship, and the whole legend of which it
          forms a part is stamped with a character of rudeness and savagery
          that speaks strongly for its antiquity.<a id="noteref_944" name=

          the genuineness of the other story seems also vouched for by the

          the spring equinox (22d March) a pine-tree was cut in the woods and
          brought into the sanctuary of Cybele, where it was treated as a
          divinity. It was adorned with woollen bands and wreaths of violets,
          for violets were said to have sprung from the blood of Attis, as
          anemones from the blood of Adonis; and the effigy of a young man
          was attached to the middle of the tree.<a id="noteref_948" name=

          third day (24th March) was known as the Day of Blood: the high
          priest drew blood from his arms and presented it as an

          was perhaps on this day or night that the mourning for Attis took
          place over an effigy, which was afterwards solemnly buried.<a id=

          resurrection of Attis was probably celebrated—at least the
          celebration of his resurrection seems to have followed closely upon
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name=

          Roman festival closed on 27th March with a procession to the brook
          Almo, in which the bullock-cart of the goddess, her image, and
          other sacred objects were bathed. But this bath of the goddess is
          known to have also formed part of her festival in her Asiatic home.
          On returning from the water the cart and oxen were strewn with
          fresh spring flowers.<a id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The original
          character of Attis as a tree-spirit is brought out plainly by the
          part which the pine-tree plays in his legend and ritual. The story
          that he was a human being transformed into a pine-tree is only one
          of those transparent attempts at rationalising the old beliefs
          which meet us so frequently in mythology. His tree origin is
          further attested by the story that he was born of a virgin, who
          conceived by putting in her bosom a ripe almond or
          pomegranate.<a id="noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href=
          "#note_954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a> The
          bringing in of the pine-tree from the wood, decked with violets and
          woollen bands, corresponds to bringing in the May-tree or
          Summer-tree in modern folk-custom; and the effigy which was
          attached to the pine-tree was only a duplicate representative of
          the tree-spirit or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg
          299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Attis. At what point of the ceremonies the violets and the effigy
          were attached to the tree is not said, but we should assume this to
          be done after the mimic death and burial of Attis. The fastening of
          his effigy to the tree would then be a representation of his coming
          to life again in tree-form, just as the placing of the shirt of the
          effigy of Death upon a tree represents the revival of the spirit of
          vegetation in a new form.<a id="noteref_955" name="noteref_955"
          href="#note_955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">955</span></span></a> After
          being attached to the tree, the effigy was kept for a year and then
          burned.<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href=
          "#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a> We
          have seen that this was apparently sometimes done with the
          May-pole;<a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href=
          "#note_957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">957</span></span></a> and
          we shall see presently that the effigy of the corn-spirit, made at
          harvest, is often preserved till it is replaced by a new effigy at
          next year's harvest. The original intention of thus preserving the
          effigy for a year and then replacing it by a new one was doubtless
          to maintain the spirit of vegetation in fresh and vigorous life.
          The bathing of the image of Cybele was probably a rain-charm, like
          the throwing of the effigies of Death and of Adonis into the water.
          Like tree-spirits in general, Attis appears to have been conceived
          as exercising power over the growth of corn, or even to have been
          identified with the corn. One of his epithets was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“very fruitful;”</span> he was addressed as the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“reaped green (or yellow) ear of
          corn,”</span> and the story of his sufferings, death, and
          resurrection was interpreted as the ripe grain wounded by the
          reaper, buried in the granary, and coming to life again when sown
          in the ground.<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href=
          "#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a> His
          worshippers abstained from eating seeds and the roots of
          vegetables,<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href=
          "#note_959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a> just
          as at the Adonis ceremonies women abstained from <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> eating corn ground in a mill. Such acts
          would probably have been esteemed a sacrilegious partaking of the
          life or of the bruised and broken body of the god.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From
          inscriptions it appears that both at Pessinus and Rome the high
          priest of Cybele was regularly called Attis.<a id="noteref_960"
          name="noteref_960" href="#note_960"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a> It is
          therefore a reasonable conjecture that the high priest played the
          part of the legendary Attis at the annual festival.<a id=
          "noteref_961" name="noteref_961" href="#note_961"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a> We
          have seen that on the Day of Blood he drew blood from his arms, and
          this may have been an imitation of the self-inflicted death of
          Attis under the pine-tree. It is not inconsistent with this
          supposition that Attis was also represented at these ceremonies by
          an effigy; for we have already had cases in which the divine being
          is first represented by a living person and afterwards by an
          effigy, which is then burned or otherwise destroyed.<a id=
          "noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="#note_962"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a>
          Perhaps we may go a step farther and conjecture that this mimic
          killing of the priest (if it was such), accompanied by a real
          effusion of his blood, was in Phrygia, as it has been elsewhere, a
          substitute for a human sacrifice which in earlier times was
          actually offered. Professor W. M. Ramsay, whose authority on all
          questions relating to Phrygia no one will dispute, is of opinion
          that at these Phrygian ceremonies <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          representative of the god was probably slain each year by a cruel
          death, just as the god himself died.”</span><a id="noteref_963"
          name="noteref_963" href="#note_963"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a> that
          the priests of Pessinus were at one time potentates as well as
          priests; they may, therefore, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          or popes whose duty it was to die each year for their people and
          the world. As a god of vegetation, annually slain, the
          representative of Attis would be parallel to the Wild Man, the
          King, etc., of north European folk-custom, and to the Italian
          priest of Nemi.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There seem to be
          some grounds for believing that Osiris, the great god of ancient
          Egypt, was one of those personifications of vegetation, whose
          annual death and resurrection have been celebrated in so many
          lands. But as the chief of the gods he appears to have absorbed the
          attributes of other deities, so that his character and rites
          present a complex of heterogeneous elements which, with the scanty
          evidence at our disposal, it is hardly possible to sort out. It may
          be worth while, however, to put together some of the facts which
          lend support to the view that Osiris or at least one of the deities
          out of whom he was compounded was a god of vegetation, analogous to
          Adonis and Attis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The outline of
          his myth is as follows.<a id="noteref_965" name="noteref_965" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">965</span></span></a>
          Osiris was the son of the earth-god Qeb (or Seb, as the name is
          sometimes transliterated).<a id="noteref_966" name="noteref_966"
          href="#note_966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Reigning as a king on earth, he reclaimed the Egyptians from
          savagery, gave them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg
          302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          laws, and taught them to worship the gods. Before his time the
          Egyptians had been cannibals. But Isis, the sister and wife of
          Osiris, discovered wheat and barley growing wild, and Osiris
          introduced the cultivation of these grains amongst his people, who
          forthwith abandoned cannibalism and took kindly to a corn
          diet.<a id="noteref_967" name="noteref_967" href=
          "#note_967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Afterwards Osiris travelled over the world diffusing the blessings
          of civilisation wherever he went. But on his return his brother Set
          (whom the Greeks called Typhon), with seventy-two others, plotted
          against him, and having inveigled him into a beautifully decorated
          coffer, they nailed it down on him, soldered it fast with molten
          lead, and flung it into the Nile. It floated down to the sea. This
          happened on the 17th day of the month Athyr. Isis put on mourning,
          and wandered disconsolately up and down seeking the body, till at
          last she found it at Byblus, on the Syrian coast, whither it had
          drifted with the waves. An <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">erica</span></span> tree had shot up and
          enfolded the coffer within its stem, and the King of Byblus,
          admiring the fine growth of the tree, had caused it to be cut down
          and converted into a pillar of his palace. From him Isis obtained
          leave to open the trunk of the tree, and having taken out the
          coffer, she carried it away with her. But she left it to visit her
          son Horus at Butus in the Delta, and Typhon found the coffer as he
          was hunting a boar by the light of a full moon.<a id="noteref_968"

          recognised the body of Osiris, rent it into fourteen pieces, and
          scattered them abroad. Isis sailed up and down the marshes in a
          papyrus boat seeking the fragments, and as she found each she
          buried it. Hence many graves of Osiris were shown in Egypt. Others
          said that Isis left an effigy of Osiris <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> in every city, pretending it was his body, in
          order that Osiris might be worshipped in many places, and to
          prevent Typhon from discovering the real corpse. Afterwards her son
          Horus fought against Typhon, conquered him, and bound him fast. But
          Isis, to whom he had been delivered, loosed his bonds and let him
          go. This angered Horus, and he pulled the crown from his mother's
          head; but Hermes replaced it with a helmet made in the shape of a
          cow's head. Typhon was subsequently defeated in two other battles.
          The rest of the myth included the dismemberment of Horus and the
          beheading of Isis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much for the
          myth of Osiris. Of the annual rites with which his death and burial
          were celebrated we unfortunately know very little. The mourning

          ceremonies began with the <span class=

          the field labours, when the waters of the Nile are sinking. The
          other rites included the search for the mangled body of Osiris, the
          rejoicings at its discovery, and its solemn burial. The burial took
          place on the 11th of November, and was accompanied by the
          recitation of lamentations from the liturgical books. These
          lamentations, of which several copies have been discovered in
          modern times, were put in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Osiris. <span class="tei tei-q">“In form and substance,”</span>
          says Brugsch, <span class="tei tei-q">“they vividly recall the
          dirges chanted at the Adonis' rites over the dead
          god.”</span><a id="noteref_971" name="noteref_971" href=

          day was the joyous festival of Sokari, that being the name under
          which the hawk-headed Osiris of Memphis was invoked. The solemn
          processions of priests which on this day wound round the temples
          with all the pomp of banners, images, and sacred emblems, were
          amongst the most stately pageants that ancient Egypt could show.
          The whole festival ended on the 16th of November with a special
          rite called the erection of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Tatu</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Tat</span></span>, or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ded</span></span> pillar.<a id="noteref_972"
          name="noteref_972" href="#note_972"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">972</span></span></a> This
          pillar appears from the monuments to have been a column with cross
          bars at the top, like the yards of a mast, or more exactly like the
          superposed capitals of a pillar.<a id="noteref_973" name=
          "noteref_973" href="#note_973"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">973</span></span></a> On a
          Theban tomb the king himself, assisted by his relations and a
          priest, is represented hauling at the ropes by which the pillar is
          being raised. The pillar was interpreted, at least in later
          Egyptian theology, as the backbone of Osiris. It might very well be
          a conventional representation of a tree stripped of its leaves; and
          if Osiris was a tree-spirit, the bare trunk and branches of a tree
          might naturally be described as his backbone. The erection of the
          column would then be, as Erman interprets it, a representation of
          the resurrection of Osiris, which, as we learn from Plutarch,
          appears to have been celebrated at his mysteries.<a id=
          "noteref_974" name="noteref_974" href="#note_974"><span class=

          Perhaps the ceremony which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Plutarch describes as taking place on the
          third day of the festival (the 19th day of the month Athyr) may
          also have referred to the resurrection. He says that on that day
          the priests carried the sacred ark down to the sea. Within the ark
          was a golden casket, into which drinking-water was poured. A shout
          then went up that Osiris was found. Then some mould was mixed with
          water, and out of the paste thus formed a crescent-shaped image was
          fashioned, which was then dressed in robes and adorned.<a id=
          "noteref_975" name="noteref_975" href="#note_975"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
          similarity of the myth and ritual of Osiris to those of Adonis and
          Attis is obvious. In all three cases we see a god whose untimely
          and violent death is mourned by a loving goddess and annually
          celebrated by their worshippers. The character of Osiris as a deity
          of vegetation is brought out by the legend that he was the first to
          teach men the use of corn, and by the fact that his annual festival
          began with ploughing the earth. He is said also to have introduced
          the cultivation of the vine.<a id="noteref_976" name="noteref_976"
          href="#note_976"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">976</span></span></a> In
          one of the chambers dedicated to Osiris in the great temple of Isis
          at Philae the dead body of Osiris is represented with stalks of
          corn springing from it, and a priest is watering the stalks from a
          pitcher which he holds in his hand. The accompanying inscription
          sets forth that <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the form of him
          whom one may not name, Osiris of the mysteries, who springs from
          the returning waters.”</span><a id="noteref_977" name="noteref_977"
          href="#note_977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">977</span></span></a> It
          would seem impossible to devise a more graphic way of representing
          Osiris as a personification of the corn; while the inscription
          proves that this personification was the kernel of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mysteries of the god, the innermost
          secret that was only revealed to the initiated. In estimating the
          mythical character of Osiris very great weight must be given to
          this monument. The legend that his mangled remains were scattered
          up and down the land may be a mythical way of expressing either the
          sowing or the winnowing of the grain. The latter interpretation is
          supported by the story that Isis placed the severed limbs of Osiris
          on a corn-sieve.<a id="noteref_978" name="noteref_978" href=
          "#note_978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">978</span></span></a> Or
          the legend may be a reminiscence of the custom of slaying a human
          victim (probably considered as a representative of the corn-spirit)
          and distributing his flesh or scattering his ashes over the fields
          to fertilise them. We have already seen that in modern Europe the
          figure of <span class="tei tei-q">“Death”</span> is sometimes torn
          in pieces, and that the fragments are then buried in the fields to
          make the crops grow well.<a id="noteref_979" name="noteref_979"
          href="#note_979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">979</span></span></a> Later
          on we shall meet with examples of human victims being treated in
          the same way. With regard to the ancient Egyptians, we have it on
          the authority of Manetho that they used to burn red-haired men and
          scatter their ashes with winnowing-fans.<a id="noteref_980" name=
          "noteref_980" href="#note_980"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">980</span></span></a> That
          this custom was not, as might perhaps have been supposed, a mere
          way of wreaking their spite on foreigners, amongst whom rather than
          amongst the native Egyptians red-haired people would generally be
          found, appears from the fact that the oxen which were sacrificed
          had also to be red; a single black or white hair found on a beast
          would have disqualified it for the sacrifice.<a id="noteref_981"
          name="noteref_981" href="#note_981"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">981</span></span></a> The
          red hair of the human victims was thus probably essential; the fact
          that they were generally foreigners was only accidental.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name=
          "Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> If, as I conjecture,
          these human sacrifices were intended to promote the growth of the
          crops—and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">winnowing</span></em> of their ashes seems to
          support this view—red-haired victims were perhaps selected as best
          fitted to represent the spirit of the golden grain. For when a god
          is represented by a living person, it is natural that the human
          representative should be chosen on the ground of his supposed
          resemblance to the god. Hence the ancient Mexicans, conceiving the
          maize as a personal being who went through the whole course of life
          between seed-time and harvest, sacrificed new-born babes when the
          maize was sown, older children when it had sprouted, and so on till
          it was fully ripe, when they sacrificed old men.<a id="noteref_982"
          name="noteref_982" href="#note_982"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">982</span></span></a> A
          name for Osiris was the <span class="tei tei-q">“crop”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“harvest”</span>;<a id="noteref_983" name=
          "noteref_983" href="#note_983"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">983</span></span></a> and
          the ancients sometimes explained him as a personification of the
          corn.<a id="noteref_984" name="noteref_984" href=
          "#note_984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Osiris was
          not only a corn-spirit; he was also a tree-spirit, and this was
          probably his original character; for, as we have already observed,
          the corn-spirit seems to be only an extension of the older
          tree-spirit. His character as a tree-spirit was represented very
          graphically in a ceremony described by Firmicus Maternus.<a id=
          "noteref_985" name="noteref_985" href="#note_985"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">985</span></span></a> A
          pine-tree was cut down, the centre was hollowed out, and with the
          wood thus excavated an image of Osiris was made, which was then
          <span class="tei tei-q">“buried”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> in the hollow of the tree. Here, again, it is
          hard to imagine how the conception of a tree as tenanted by a
          personal being could be more plainly expressed. The image of Osiris
          thus made was kept for a year and then burned, exactly as was done
          with the image of Attis which was attached to the pine-tree. The
          ceremony of cutting the tree, as described by Firmicus Maternus,
          appears to be alluded to by Plutarch.<a id="noteref_986" name=
          "noteref_986" href="#note_986"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">986</span></span></a> It
          was probably the ritual counterpart of the mythical discovery of
          the body of Osiris enclosed in the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">erica</span></span> tree. We may conjecture
          that the erection of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Tatu</span></span> pillar at the close of the
          annual festival of Osiris<a id="noteref_987" name="noteref_987"
          href="#note_987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">987</span></span></a> was
          identical with the ceremony described by Firmicus; it is to be
          noted that in the myth the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">erica</span></span> tree formed a pillar in
          the King's house. Like the similar custom of cutting a pine-tree
          and fastening an image to it in the rites of Attis, the ceremony
          perhaps belonged to that class of customs of which the bringing in
          the May-pole is among the most familiar. As to the pine-tree in
          particular, at Denderah the tree of Osiris is a conifer, and the
          coffer containing the body of Osiris is here represented as
          enclosed within the tree.<a id="noteref_988" name="noteref_988"
          href="#note_988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">988</span></span></a> A
          pine-cone is often represented on the monuments as offered to
          Osiris, and a MS. of the Louvre speaks of the cedar as sprung from

          at How (Diospolis Parva) a tamarisk is represented overshadowing
          the coffer of Osiris; and in the series of sculptures which
          represent the mystic history of Osiris in the great temple of Isis
          at Philae, a tamarisk is depicted with two men pouring water on it.
          The inscription on this last monument leaves no doubt, says
          Brugsch, that the verdure of the earth is believed to be connected
          with the verdure of the tree, and that the sculpture refers to the
          grave of Osiris at Philae, of which Plutarch says that it was
          overshadowed by a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">methide</span></span> plant, taller than any
          olive-tree. This sculpture, it may be observed, occurs in the same
          chamber in which Osiris is represented as a corpse with ears of
          corn sprouting from him.<a id="noteref_992" name="noteref_992"

          accords with the character of Osiris as a tree-spirit that his
          worshippers were forbidden to injure fruit-trees, and with his
          character as a god of vegetation in general that they were not
          allowed to stop up wells of water, which are so important for

          According to Diodorus, whose authority appears to have been the
          Egyptian historian Manetho, the discovery of wheat and barley was
          attributed to Isis, and at her festivals stalks of these grains
          were carried in procession to commemorate the boon she had
          conferred on men. Further, at harvest-time, when the Egyptian
          reapers had cut the first stalks, they laid them down and beat
          their breasts, lamenting and calling upon Isis.<a id="noteref_999"

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the green one, whose greenness is like the

          According to Brugsch she is <span class="tei tei-q">“not only the
          creatress of the fresh verdure of vegetation which covers the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Osiris has been
          sometimes interpreted as the sun-god; and this view has been held
          by so many distinguished writers in modern times that a few words
          of reply seem called for. If we inquire on what evidence Osiris has
          been identified with the sun or the sun-god, it will be found on
          examination that the evidence is minute in quantity and dubious,
          where it is not absolutely worthless, in quality. The diligent
          Jablonski, the first modern scholar to collect and examine the
          testimony of classical writers on Egyptian religion, says that it
          can be shown in many ways that Osiris is the sun, and that he could
          produce a cloud of witnesses to prove it, but that it is needless
          to do so, since no learned man is ignorant of the fact.<a id=
          "noteref_1006" name="noteref_1006" href="#note_1006"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1006</span></span></a> Of
          the writers whom he condescends to quote, the only two who
          expressly identify Osiris with the sun are Diodorus and Macrobius.
          The passage in Diodorus runs thus:<a id="noteref_1007" name=
          "noteref_1007" href="#note_1007"><span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“It is said that the aboriginal inhabitants
          of Egypt, looking up to the sky, and smitten with awe and wonder at
          the nature of the universe, supposed that there were two gods,
          eternal and primeval, the sun and the moon, of whom they named the
          sun Osiris and the moon Isis.”</span> Even if Diodorus's authority
          for this statement is Manetho, as there is some ground for
          believing,<a id="noteref_1008" name="noteref_1008" href=

          can be attached to it. For it is plainly a philosophical, and
          therefore a late, explanation of the first beginnings of Egyptian
          religion, reminding us of Kant's familiar saying about the starry
          heavens and the moral law rather than of the rude traditions of a
          primitive people. Jablonski's second authority, Macrobius, is no
          better but rather worse. For Macrobius was the father of that large
          family of mythologists who resolve all or most gods into the sun.
          According to him Mercury was the sun, Mars was the sun, Janus was
          the sun, Saturn was the sun, so was Jupiter, also Nemesis, likewise
          Pan, etc.<a id="noteref_1009" name="noteref_1009" href=

          was, therefore, nearly a matter of course that he should identify
          Osiris with the sun.<a id="noteref_1010" name="noteref_1010" href=

          apart from the general principle, so frankly enunciated by
          Professor Maspero, that all the gods are the sun (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          Macrobius has not much cause to show for identifying Osiris in
          particular with the sun. He argues that Osiris must be the sun
          because an eye was one of his symbols. The premise is
          correct,<a id="noteref_1012" name="noteref_1012" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1012</span></span></a> but
          what exactly it has to do with the conclusion is not clear. The
          opinion that Osiris was the sun is also mentioned, but not
          accepted, by Plutarch,<a id="noteref_1013" name="noteref_1013"
          href="#note_1013"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1013</span></span></a> and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amongst modern
          Egyptologists, Lepsius, in identifying Osiris with the sun, appears
          to rely mainly on the passage of Diodorus already quoted. But the
          monuments, he adds, also show <span class="tei tei-q">“that down to
          a late time Osiris was sometimes conceived as <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Book of the Dead,’</span> <span class=

          Ra was both the physical sun and the sun-god is of course
          undisputed; but with every deference for the authority of so great
          a scholar as Lepsius, it may be doubted whether such identification
          can be taken as evidence of the original character of Osiris. For
          the religion of ancient Egypt<a id="noteref_1016" name=
          "noteref_1016" href="#note_1016"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a> may
          be described as a confederacy of local cults which, while
          maintaining against each other a certain measure of jealous and
          even hostile independence, were yet constantly subjected to the
          fusing and amalgamating action of political centralisation and
          philosophical reflection. The history of the religion appears to
          have largely consisted of a struggle between these opposite forces
          or tendencies. On the one side there was the conservative tendency
          to preserve the local cults with all their distinctive features,
          fresh, sharp, and crisp, as they had been handed down from an
          immemorial past. On the other side there was the progressive
          tendency, favoured by the gradual fusion of the people under a
          powerful central government, first to dull the edge of these
          provincial distinctions, and finally to break them down completely
          and merge them in a single national religion. The conservative
          party probably mustered in its ranks the great bulk of the people,
          their prejudices and affections being warmly enlisted in favour of
          the local deity, with whose temple and rites they had been familiar
          from childhood; and the popular aversion to change, based on the
          endearing effect of old association, must <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> have been strongly reinforced by the less
          disinterested opposition of the local clergy, whose material
          interests would necessarily suffer with any decay of their shrines.
          On the other hand the kings, whose power and glory rose with the
          political and ecclesiastical consolidation of the nation, were the
          natural champions of religious unity; and their efforts would be
          seconded by the cultured and reflecting minority, who could hardly
          fail to be shocked by the many barbarous and revolting elements in
          the local rites. As usual in such cases, the process of religious
          unification appears to have been largely effected by discovering
          points of similarity, real or imaginary, between various local
          gods, which were thereupon declared to be only different names or
          manifestations of the same god.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the deities
          who thus acted as centres of attraction, absorbing in themselves a
          multitude of minor divinities, by far the most important was the
          sun-god Ra. There appear to have been few gods in Egypt who were
          not at one time or other identified with him. Ammon of Thebes,
          Horus of the East, Horus of Edfu, Chnum of Elephantine, Atum of
          Heliopolis, all were regarded as one god, the sun. Even the
          water-god Sobk, in spite of his crocodile shape, did not escape the
          same fate. Indeed one king, Amenhôtep IV, undertook to sweep away
          all the old gods at a stroke and replace them by a single god, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“great living disc of the
          sun.”</span><a id="noteref_1017" name="noteref_1017" href=
          "#note_1017"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1017</span></span></a> In
          the hymns composed in his honour, this deity is referred to as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the living disc of the sun, besides whom
          there is none other.”</span> He is said to have made <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the far heaven”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“men, beasts, and birds; he strengtheneth <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the eyes with his beams, and when he
          showeth himself, all flowers live and grow, the meadows flourish at
          his upgoing and are drunken at his sight, all cattle skip on their
          feet, and the birds that are in the marsh flutter for joy.”</span>
          It is he <span class="tei tei-q">“who bringeth the years, createth
          the months, maketh the days, calculateth the hours, the lord of
          time, by whom men reckon.”</span> In his zeal for the unity of god,
          the king commanded to erase the names of all other gods from the
          monuments, and to destroy their images. His rage was particularly
          directed against the god Ammon, whose name and likeness were
          effaced wherever they were found; even the sanctity of the tomb was
          violated in order to destroy the memorials of the hated god. In
          some of the halls of the great temples at Carnac, Luxor, and other
          places, all the names of the gods, with a few chance exceptions,
          were scratched out. In no inscription cut in this king's reign was
          any god mentioned save the sun. He even changed his own name,
          Amenhôtep, because it was compounded of Ammon, and took instead the
          name of Chuen-'eten, <span class="tei tei-q">“gleam of the sun's
          disc.”</span> His death was followed by a violent reaction. The old
          gods were reinstated in their rank and privileges; their names and
          images were restored; and new temples were built. But all the
          shrines and palaces reared by the late king were thrown down; even
          the sculptures that referred to him and to his god in rock-tombs
          and on the sides of hills were erased or filled up with stucco; his
          name appears on no later monument, and was carefully omitted from
          all official lists.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This attempt of
          King Amenhôtep IV is only an extreme example of a tendency which
          appears to have been at work on the religion of Egypt as far back
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name=
          "Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as we can trace it.
          Therefore, to come back to our point, in attempting to discover the
          original character of any Egyptian god, no weight can be given to
          the identification of him with other gods, least of all with the
          sun-god Ra. Far from helping to follow up the trail, these
          identifications only cross and confuse it. The best evidence for
          the original character of the Egyptian gods is to be found in their
          ritual and myths, so far as these are known (which unfortunately is
          little enough), and in the figured representations of them on the
          monuments. It is on evidence drawn from these sources that I rely
          mainly for the interpretation of Osiris as a deity of
          vegetation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amongst a
          younger generation of scholars, Tiele is of opinion that Osiris is
          the sun, because <span class="tei tei-q">“in the hymns, his
          accession to the throne of his father is compared to the rising of
          the sun, and it is even said of him in so many words: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘He glitters on the horizon, he sends out rays of light
          from his double feather and inundates the world with it, as the sun
          from out the highest heaven.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_1018"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1018</span></span></a> By
          the same token Marie Antoinette must have been a goddess of the
          morning star, because Burke saw her at Versailles <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the
          elevated sphere she just began to move in,—glittering like the
          morning star, full of life, and splendour, and joy.”</span> If such
          comparisons prove anything, they prove that Osiris was <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the
          sun. There are always two terms to a comparison; a thing cannot be
          compared to itself. But Tiele also appeals to the monuments. What
          is his evidence? Osiris is sometimes represented by a figure
          surmounted by <span class="tei tei-q">“the so-called Tat pillar,
          entirely made up of a kind of superimposed capitals, one of which
          has a rude face scratched <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg
          317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          upon it.”</span> Tiele is of opinion that this rude face is
          <span class="tei tei-q">“intended, no doubt, to represent the
          shining sun.”</span><a id="noteref_1019" name="noteref_1019" href=

          every <span class="tei tei-q">“rude face scratched”</span> is to be
          taken as a symbol of the shining sun, sun-worship will be
          discovered in some unexpected places. But, on the whole, Tiele,
          like Jablonski, prudently keeps to the high ground of vague
          generalities, and the result of his occasional descents to the
          level of facts is not such as to encourage him to prolong his stay.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Were we to come down to details,”</span>
          he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“and to attend to slight
          variations, we should be lost in an ocean of symbolism and
          mysticism.”</span><a id="noteref_1020" name="noteref_1020" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Le Page

          his position is still stronger than Tiele's. For whereas Tiele
          produces bad arguments for his view, Mr. Renouf produces none at
          all, and therefore cannot possibly be confuted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ground upon
          which some recent writers seem chiefly to rely for the
          identification of Osiris with the sun is that the story of his
          death fits better with the solar phenomena than with any other in
          nature. It may readily be admitted that the daily appearance and
          disappearance of the sun might very naturally be expressed by a
          myth of his death and resurrection; and writers who regard Osiris
          as the sun are careful to emphasise the fact that it is the
          diurnal, and not the annual, course of the sun to which they
          understand the myth to apply. Mr. Renouf expressly admits that the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name=
          "Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Egyptian sun cannot
          with any show of reason be described as dead in winter.<a id=
          "noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022" href="#note_1022"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a> But
          if his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">daily</span></em> death was the theme of the
          legend, why was it celebrated by an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">annual</span></em>
          ceremony? This fact alone seems fatal to the interpretation of the
          myth as descriptive of sunset and sunrise. Again, though the sun
          may be said to die daily, in what sense can he be said to be torn
          in pieces?<a id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023" href=
          "#note_1023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the course of
          our inquiry, it has, I trust, been made clear that there is another
          natural phenomenon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg
          319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to which the conception of death and resurrection is as applicable
          as to sunset and sunrise, and which, as a matter of fact has been
          so conceived and represented in folk-custom. This phenomenon is the
          annual growth and decay of vegetation. A strong reason for
          interpreting the death of Osiris as the decay of vegetation rather
          than as the sunset is to be found in the general (though not
          unanimous) voice of antiquity, which classed together the worship
          and myths of Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, and Demeter, as
          religions of essentially the same type.<a id="noteref_1024" name=
          "noteref_1024" href="#note_1024"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1024</span></span></a> The
          consensus of ancient opinion on this subject seems too great to be
          rejected as a mere fancy. So closely did the rites of Osiris
          resemble those of Adonis at Byblus that some of the people of
          Byblus themselves maintained that it was Osiris and not Adonis
          whose death was mourned by them.<a id="noteref_1025" name=
          "noteref_1025" href="#note_1025"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1025</span></span></a> Such
          a view could certainly not have been held if the rituals of the two
          gods had not been so alike as to be almost indistinguishable.
          Again, Herodotus found the similarity between the rites of Osiris
          and Dionysus so great, that he thought it impossible the latter
          could have arisen independently; they must, he thought, have been
          recently borrowed, with slight alterations, by the Greeks from the
          Egyptians.<a id="noteref_1026" name="noteref_1026" href=
          "#note_1026"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1026</span></span></a>
          Again, Plutarch, a very intelligent student of comparative
          religion, insists upon the detailed resemblance of the rites of
          Osiris to those of Dionysus.<a id="noteref_1027" name=
          "noteref_1027" href="#note_1027"><span class=

          320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          reject the evidence of such intelligent and trustworthy witnesses
          on plain matters of fact which fell under their own cognisance.
          Their explanations of the worships it is indeed possible to reject,
          for the meaning of religious cults is often open to question; but
          resemblances of ritual are matters of observation. Therefore, those
          who explain Osiris as the sun are driven to the alternative of
          either dismissing as mistaken the testimony of antiquity to the
          similarity of the rites of Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, and
          Demeter, or of interpreting all these rites as sun-worship. No
          modern scholar has fairly faced and accepted either side of this
          alternative. To accept the former would be to affirm that we know
          the rites of these deities better than the men who practised, or at
          least who witnessed them. To accept the latter would involve a
          wrenching, clipping, mangling, and distorting of myth and ritual
          from which even Macrobius shrank.<a id="noteref_1028" name=
          "noteref_1028" href="#note_1028"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1028</span></span></a> On
          the other hand, the view that the essence of all these rites was
          the mimic death and revival of vegetation, explains them separately
          and collectively in an easy and natural way, and harmonises with
          the general testimony borne by antiquity to their substantial
          similarity. The evidence for thus explaining Adonis, Attis, and
          Osiris has now been presented to the reader; it remains to do the
          same for Dionysus and Demeter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like the other
          gods of vegetation whom we have been considering, Dionysus was
          believed to have died a violent death, but to have been brought to
          life again; and his sufferings, death, and resurrection were
          enacted in his sacred rites. The Cretan myth, as related by
          Firmicus, ran thus. He was said to have been the bastard son of
          Jupiter (Zeus), a Cretan king. Going abroad, Jupiter transferred
          the throne and sceptre to the child Dionysus, but, knowing that his
          wife Juno (Hera) cherished a jealous dislike of the child, he
          entrusted Dionysus to the care of guards upon whose fidelity he
          believed he could rely. Juno, however, bribed the guards, and
          amusing the child with toys and a cunningly-wrought looking-glass
          lured him into an ambush, where her satellites, the Titans, rushed
          upon him, cut him limb from limb, boiled his body <span class=

          sister Minerva, who had shared in the deed, kept his heart and gave
          it to Jupiter on his return, revealing to him the whole history of
          the crime. In his rage, Jupiter put the Titans to death by torture,
          and, to soothe his grief for the loss of his son, made an image in
          which he enclosed the child's heart, and then built a temple in his

          danced a war-dance round the infant Dionysus as they are said to

          anemones from the blood of Adonis and violets from the blood of
          Attis. According to some, the severed limbs of Dionysus were pieced

          leave no room to doubt that in rending and devouring a live bull at

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This custom of
          killing a god in animal form, which we shall examine more fully
          presently, belongs to a very early stage in human culture, and is
          apt in later times to be misunderstood. The advance of thought
          tends to strip the old animal and plant gods of their bestial and
          vegetable husk, and to leave their human attributes (which are
          always the kernel of the conception) as the final and sole
          residuum. In other words, animal and plant gods tend to become
          purely anthropomorphic. When they have become wholly or nearly so,
          the animals and plants which were at first the deities themselves,
          still retain a vague and ill-understood connection with the
          anthropomorphic gods which have been developed out of them. The
          origin of the relationship between the deity and the animal or
          plant having been forgotten, various stories are invented to
          explain it. These explanations may follow one of two lines
          according as they are based on the habitual or on the exceptional
          treatment of the sacred animal or plant. The sacred animal was
          habitually spared, and only exceptionally slain; and accordingly
          the myth might be devised to explain either why it was spared or
          why <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name=
          "Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it was killed.
          Devised for the former purpose, the myth would tell of some service
          rendered to the deity by the animal; devised for the latter
          purpose, the myth would tell of some injury inflicted by the animal
          on the god. The reason given for sacrificing goats to Dionysus is
          an example of a myth of the latter sort. They were sacrificed to
          him, it was said, because they injured the vine.<a id=
          "noteref_1080" name="noteref_1080" href="#note_1080"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1080</span></span></a> Now
          the goat, as we have seen, was originally an embodiment of the god
          himself. But when the god had divested himself of his animal
          character and had become essentially anthropomorphic, the killing
          of the goat in his worship came to be regarded no longer as a
          slaying of the god himself, but as a sacrifice to him; and since
          some reason had to be assigned why the goat in particular should be
          sacrificed, it was alleged that this was a punishment inflicted on
          the goat for injuring the vine, the object of the god's especial
          care. Thus we have the strange spectacle of a god sacrificed to
          himself on the ground that he is his own enemy. And as the god is
          supposed to partake of the victim offered to him, it follows that,
          when the victim is the god's old self, the god eats of his own
          flesh. Hence the goat-god Dionysus is represented as eating raw
          goat's blood;<a id="noteref_1081" name="noteref_1081" href=
          "#note_1081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1081</span></span></a> and
          the bull-god Dionysus is called <span class="tei tei-q">“eater of
          bulls.”</span><a id="noteref_1082" name="noteref_1082" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1082</span></span></a> On
          the analogy of these instances we may conjecture that wherever a
          god is described as the eater of a particular animal, the animal in
          question was originally nothing but the god himself.<a id=
          "noteref_1083" name="noteref_1083" href="#note_1083"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this,
          however, does not explain why a deity of vegetation should appear
          in animal form. But the consideration of this point had better be
          deferred till we have discussed the character and attributes of
          Demeter. Meantime it remains to point out that in some places,
          instead of an animal, a human being was torn in pieces at the rites
          of Dionysus. This was the custom in Chios and Tenedos;<a id=

          at Potniae in Boeotia the tradition ran that it had been formerly
          the custom to sacrifice to the goat-smiting Dionysus a child, for
          whom a goat was afterwards substituted.<a id="noteref_1085" name=

          Orchomenus the human victim was taken from the women of a certain
          family, called the Oleiae. At the annual festival the priest of
          Dionysus pursued these women with a drawn sword, and if he overtook
          one of them he had a right to slay her. This right was exercised as
          late as Plutarch's time.<a id="noteref_1086" name="noteref_1086"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1086</span></span></a> As
          the slain bull or goat represented the slain god, so, we may
          suppose, the human victim also represented him. It is possible,
          however, that a tradition of human sacrifice may sometimes have
          been a mere misinterpretation of a sacrificial ritual in which an
          animal victim was treated as a human being. For example, at Tenedos
          the new-born calf sacrificed to Dionysus was shod in buskins, and
          the mother cow was tended like a woman in child-bed.<a id=

          Greek myth, as in its Asiatic and Egyptian counterparts, a
          goddess—Demeter—mourns the loss of a loved one—Proserpine—who
          personifies the vegetation, more especially the corn, which dies in

          revive in spring. But in the Greek myth the loved and lost one is
          the daughter instead of the husband or lover of the goddess; and

          Dead, issuing from the abyss, carried her off on his golden car to
          be his bride in the gloomy subterranean world. Her sorrowing mother

          represented in her rites.<a id="noteref_1093" name="noteref_1093"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
          the name Demeter, it has been plausibly argued by Mannhardt<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1094</span></span></a> that
          the first part of the word is derived from <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">dēai</span></span>, a Cretan word for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“barley”</span>;<a id="noteref_1095" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1095</span></span></a> and
          that thus Demeter means the Barley-mother or the Corn-mother; for
          the root of the word appears to have been applied to different
          kinds of grain by different branches of the Aryans, and even of the
          Greeks themselves.<a id="noteref_1096" name="noteref_1096" href=

          Crete appears to have been one of the most ancient seats of the

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1097</span></span></a> it
          is not surprising that her name should be of Cretan origin. This
          explanation of the name Demeter is supported by a host of analogies
          which the diligence of Mannhardt has collected <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> from modern European folk-lore, and of
          which the following are specimens. In Germany the corn is very
          commonly personified under the name of the Corn-mother. Thus in
          spring, when the wind sets the corn in wave-like motion, the
          peasants say, <span class="tei tei-q">“There comes the
          Corn-mother,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“The Corn-mother is
          running over the field,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Corn-mother is going through the corn.”</span><a id="noteref_1098"
          name="noteref_1098" href="#note_1098"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1098</span></span></a> When
          children wish to go into the fields to pull the blue corn-flowers
          or the red poppies, they are told not to do so, because the
          Corn-mother is sitting in the corn and will catch them.<a id=
          "noteref_1099" name="noteref_1099" href="#note_1099"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1099</span></span></a> Or
          again she is called, according to the crop, the Rye-mother or the
          Pea-mother, and children are warned against straying in the rye or
          among the peas by threats of the Rye-mother or the Pea-mother. In
          Norway also the Pea-mother is said to sit among the peas.<a id=
          "noteref_1100" name="noteref_1100" href="#note_1100"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1100</span></span></a>
          Similar expressions are current among the Slavs. The Poles and
          Czechs warn children against the Corn-mother who sits in the corn.
          Or they call her the Old Corn-woman, and say that she sits in the
          corn and strangles the children who tread it down.<a id=
          "noteref_1101" name="noteref_1101" href="#note_1101"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1101</span></span></a> The
          Lithuanians say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Old Rye-woman sits in

          Again the Corn-mother is believed to make the crop grow. Thus in
          the neighbourhood of Magdeburg it is sometimes said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It will be a good year for flax; the Flax-mother has
          been seen.”</span> At Dinkelsbühl (Bavaria) down to fifteen or
          twenty years ago, people believed that when the crops on a
          particular farm compared unfavourably with those of the
          neighbourhood, the reason was that the Corn-mother had punished the
          farmer for his sins.<a id="noteref_1103" name="noteref_1103" href=
          "#note_1103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1103</span></span></a> In a
          village of Styria it is said that the Corn-mother, in the shape of
          a female <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg
          333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          puppet made out of the last sheaf of corn and dressed in white, may
          be seen at midnight in the corn-fields, which she fertilises by
          passing through them; but if she is angry with a farmer, she
          withers up all his corn.<a id="noteref_1104" name="noteref_1104"
          href="#note_1104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, the
          Corn-mother plays an important part in harvest customs. She is
          believed to be present in the handful of corn which is left
          standing last on the field; and with the cutting of this last
          handful she is caught, or driven away, or killed. In the first of
          these cases, the last sheaf is carried joyfully home and honoured
          as a divine being. It is placed in the barn, and at threshing the
          corn-spirit appears again.<a id="noteref_1105" name="noteref_1105"
          href="#note_1105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1105</span></span></a> In
          the district of Hadeln (Hanover) the reapers stand round the last
          sheaf and beat it with sticks in order to drive the Corn-mother out
          of it. They call to each other, <span class="tei tei-q">“There she
          is! hit her! Take care she doesn't catch you!”</span> The beating
          goes on till the grain is completely threshed out; then the
          Corn-mother is believed to be driven away.<a id="noteref_1106"
          name="noteref_1106" href="#note_1106"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1106</span></span></a> In
          the neighbourhood of Danzig the person who cuts the last ears of
          corn makes them into a doll, which is called the Corn-mother or the
          Old Woman, and is brought home on the last waggon.<a id=
          "noteref_1107" name="noteref_1107" href="#note_1107"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1107</span></span></a> In
          some parts of Holstein the last sheaf is dressed in woman's clothes
          and called the Corn-mother. It is carried home on the last waggon,
          and then thoroughly drenched with water. The drenching with water
          is doubtless a rain-charm.<a id="noteref_1108" name="noteref_1108"
          href="#note_1108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1108</span></span></a> In
          the district of Bruck in Styria the last sheaf, called the
          Corn-mother, is made up into the shape of a woman by the oldest
          married woman in the village, of an age from fifty to fifty-five
          years. The finest ears are plucked out of it <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and made into a wreath, which, twined
          with flowers, is carried on her head by the prettiest girl of the
          village to the farmer or squire, while the Corn-mother is laid down
          in the barn to keep off the mice.<a id="noteref_1109" name=
          "noteref_1109" href="#note_1109"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1109</span></span></a> In
          other villages of the same district the Corn-mother, at the close
          of harvest, is carried by two lads at the top of a pole. They march
          behind the girl who wears the wreath to the squire's house, and
          while he receives the wreath and hangs it up in the hall, the
          Corn-mother is placed on the top of a pile of wood, where she is
          the centre of the harvest supper and dance. Afterwards she is hung
          up in the barn and remains there till the threshing is over. The
          man who gives the last stroke at threshing is called the son of the
          Corn-mother; he is tied up in the Corn-mother, beaten, and carried
          through the village. The wreath is dedicated in church on the
          following Sunday; and on Easter Eve the grain is rubbed out of it
          by a seven years' old girl and scattered amongst the young corn. At
          Christmas the straw of the wreath is placed in the manger to make
          the cattle thrive.<a id="noteref_1110" name="noteref_1110" href=
          "#note_1110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1110</span></span></a> Here
          the fertilising power of the Corn-mother is plainly brought out by
          scattering the seed taken from her body (for the wreath is made out
          of the Corn-mother) among the new corn; and her influence over
          animal life is indicated by placing the straw in the manger. At
          Westerhüsen in Saxony the last corn cut is made in the shape of a
          woman decked with ribbons and cloth. It is fastened on a pole and
          brought home on the last waggon. One of the people on the waggon
          keeps waving the pole, so that the figure moves as if alive. It is
          placed on the threshing-floor, and stays there till the threshing
          is done.<a id="noteref_1111" name="noteref_1111" href=
          "#note_1111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a>
          Amongst the Slavs also the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> last sheaf is known as the Rye-mother, the
          Wheat-mother, the Oats-mother, the Barley-mother, etc., according
          to the crop. In the district of Tarnow, Galicia, the wreath made
          out of the last stalks is called the Wheat-mother, Rye-mother, or
          Pea-mother. It is placed on a girl's head and kept till spring,
          when some of the grain is mixed with the seed-corn.<a id=
          "noteref_1112" name="noteref_1112" href="#note_1112"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1112</span></span></a> Here
          again the fertilising power of the Corn-mother is indicated. In
          France, also, in the neighbourhood of Auxerre, the last sheaf goes
          by the name of the Mother of the Wheat, Mother of the Barley,
          Mother of the Rye, or Mother of the Oats. It is left standing in
          the field till the last waggon is about to wend homewards. Then a
          puppet is made out of it, dressed with clothes belonging to the
          farmer, and adorned with a crown and a blue or white scarf. A
          branch of a tree is stuck in the breast of the puppet, which is now
          called the Ceres. At the dance in the evening the Ceres is placed
          in the middle of the floor, and the reaper who reaped fastest
          dances round it with the prettiest girl for his partner. After the
          dance a pyre is made. All the girls, each wearing a wreath, strip
          the puppet, pull it to pieces, and place it on the pyre, along with
          the flowers with which it was adorned. Then the girl who was the
          first to finish reaping sets fire to the pile, and all pray that
          Ceres may give a fruitful year. Here, as Mannhardt observes, the
          old custom has remained intact, though the name Ceres is a bit of
          schoolmaster's learning.<a id="noteref_1113" name="noteref_1113"
          href="#note_1113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1113</span></span></a> In
          Upper Britanny the last sheaf is always made into human shape; but
          if the farmer is a married man, it is made double and consists of a
          little corn-puppet placed inside of a large one. This is called the
          Mother-sheaf. It is delivered to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> farmer's wife, who unties it and gives
          drink-money in return.<a id="noteref_1114" name="noteref_1114"
          href="#note_1114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
          last sheaf is called, not the Corn-mother, but the Harvest-mother
          or the Great Mother. In the province of Osnabrück (Hanover) it is
          called the Harvest-mother; it is made up in female form, and then
          the reapers dance about with it. In some parts of Westphalia the
          last sheaf at the rye harvest is made especially heavy by fastening
          stones in it. It is brought home on the last waggon and is called
          the Great Mother, though no special shape is given it. In the
          district of Erfurt a very heavy sheaf (not necessarily the last) is
          called the Great Mother, and is carried on the last waggon to the
          barn, where it is lifted down by all hands amid a fire of
          jokes.<a id="noteref_1115" name="noteref_1115" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes again
          the last sheaf is called the Grandmother, and is adorned with
          flowers, ribbons, and a woman's apron. In East Prussia, at the rye
          or wheat harvest, the reapers call out to the woman who binds the
          last sheaf, <span class="tei tei-q">“You are getting the Old
          Grandmother.”</span> In the neighbourhood of Magdeburg the men and
          women servants strive who shall get the last sheaf, called the
          Grandmother. Whoever gets it will be married in the next year, but
          his or her spouse will be old; if a girl gets it, she will marry a
          widower; if a man gets it, he will marry an old crone. In Silesia
          the Grandmother—a huge bundle made up of three or four sheaves by
          the person who tied the last sheaf—was formerly fashioned into a
          rude likeness of the human form.<a id="noteref_1116" name=

          the neighbourhood of Belfast the last sheaf is sometimes called
          Granny. It is not cut in the usual way, but all the reapers throw
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name=
          "Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> their sickles at it
          and try to bring it down. It is plaited and kept till the (next?)
          autumn. Whoever gets it will marry in the course of the year.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oftener the last
          sheaf is called the Old Woman or the Old Man. In Germany it is
          often shaped and dressed as a woman, and the person who cuts it or
          binds it is said to <span class="tei tei-q">“get the Old

          Altisheim in Swabia when all the corn of a farm has been cut except
          a single strip, all the reapers stand in a row before the strip;
          each cuts his share rapidly, and he who gives the last cut

          Neusaass, West Prussia, both the last sheaf—which is dressed up in
          jacket, hat and ribbons—and the woman who binds it are called the

          Hornkampe, near Tiegenhof (West Prussia), when a man or woman lags
          behind the rest in binding the corn, the other reapers dress up the
          last sheaf in the form of a man or woman, and this figure goes by
          the laggard's name, as <span class="tei tei-q">“the old
          Michael,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the idle Trine.”</span>
          It is brought home on the last waggon, and, as it nears the house,
          the bystanders call out to the laggard, <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          customs, as Mannhardt has remarked, the person who is called by the
          same name as the last sheaf and sits beside it on the last waggon
          is obviously identified with it; he or she represents the
          corn-spirit which has been caught in the last sheaf; in other
          words, the corn-spirit is represented in duplicate, by a human
          being and by a sheaf.<a id="noteref_1124" name="noteref_1124" href=

          identification of the person with the sheaf is made still clearer
          by the custom of wrapping up in the last sheaf the person who cuts
          or binds it. Thus at Hermsdorf in Silesia it used to be the regular
          custom to tie up in the last sheaf the woman who had bound
          it.<a id="noteref_1125" name="noteref_1125" href=

          the person wrapt up in the corn represents the corn-spirit, exactly

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last sheaf,
          designated as the Old Woman, is often distinguished from the other
          sheaves by its size and weight. Thus in some villages of West
          Prussia the Old Woman is made twice as long and thick as a common
          sheaf, and a stone is fastened in the middle of it. Sometimes it is
          made so heavy that a man can barely lift it.<a id="noteref_1128"

          Sometimes eight or nine sheaves are tied together to make the Old
          Woman, and the man who sets it up complains of its weight.<a id=

          Itzgrund, in Saxe-Coburg, the last sheaf, called the Old Woman, is

          the custom of making the last sheaf unusually large or heavy is a
          charm, working by sympathetic magic, to secure a large and heavy
          crop in the following year.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Denmark also
          the last sheaf is made larger than the others, and is called the
          Old Rye-woman or the Old Barley-woman. No one likes to bind it,
          because whoever does so will, it is believed, marry an old man or
          an old woman. Sometimes the last wheat-sheaf, called the Old
          Wheat-woman, is made up in human shape, with head, arms, and legs,
          is dressed in clothes and carried home on the last waggon, the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Scotland,
          when the last corn was cut after Hallowmas, the female figure made
          out of it was sometimes called the Carlin or Carline, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
          the Old Woman. But if cut before Hallowmas, it was called the

          few years ago, when the sickle was finally expelled by the reaping
          machine, the few stalks of corn left standing last on the field
          were plaited together; then the reapers, blindfolded, threw their
          sickles at the plaited corn, and whoever happened to cut it through
          took it home with him and put it over his door. This bunch of corn
          was called the Carley<a id="noteref_1134" name="noteref_1134" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similar customs
          are observed by Slavonic peoples. Thus in Poland the last sheaf is

          "tei tei-q">“In the last sheaf,”</span> it is said, <span class=

          some parts of Bohemia the Baba, made out of the last sheaf, has the
          figure of a woman with a great straw hat. It is carried home on the
          last harvest-waggon and delivered, along with a garland, to the
          farmer by two girls. In binding the sheaves the women strive not to
          be last, for she who binds the last sheaf will have a child next
          year.<a id="noteref_1136" name="noteref_1136" href=

          Sometimes the harvesters call out to the woman who binds the last
          sheaf, <span class="tei tei-q">“She has the Baba,”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“She is the Baba.”</span> She has then to
          make a puppet, sometimes in female, sometimes in male form, out of
          the corn; the puppet is occasionally dressed with clothes, often
          with flowers and ribbons only. The cutter of the last stalks, as
          well as the binder of the last sheaf, was also called Baba; and a
          doll, called the Harvest-woman, was made out of the last sheaf and
          adorned with ribbons. The oldest reaper had to dance, first with
          this doll, and then with the farmer's wife.<a id="noteref_1138"

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Grandfather is sitting in it;”</span>
          when a woman binds it, they say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Baba
          is sitting in it,”</span> and the woman herself is wrapt up in the
          sheaf, so that only her head projects out of it. Thus encased in
          the sheaf, she is carried on the last harvest-waggon to the house,
          where she is drenched with water by the whole family. She remains
          in the sheaf till the dance is over, and for a year she retains the
          name of Baba.<a id="noteref_1139" name="noteref_1139" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Lithuania the

          the last sheaf is often shaped and dressed as a woman, and carried
          with dance and song to the farmhouse. Out of the last sheaf the
          Bulgarians make a doll which they call the Corn-queen or
          Corn-mother; it is dressed in a woman's shirt, carried round the
          village, and then thrown into the river in order to secure plenty
          of rain and dew for the next year's crop. Or it is burned and the

          morning of the conclusive reaping day, with music and much clamour
          of the reapers, into the field, where it stands fixed on a pole all

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Often the
          customs we have been examining are practised, not on the harvest
          field, but on the threshing-floor. The spirit of the corn, fleeing
          before the reapers as they cut down the corn, quits the cut corn
          and takes refuge in the barn, where it appears in the last sheaf
          threshed, either to perish under the blows of the flail or to flee
          thence to the still unthreshed corn of a neighbouring farm.<a id=

          the last corn to be threshed is called the Mother-corn or the Old
          Woman. Sometimes the person who gives the last stroke with the
          flail is called the Old Woman, and is wrapt in the straw of the
          last sheaf, or has a bundle of straw fastened on his back. Whether
          wrapt in the straw or carrying it on his back, he is carted through
          the village amid general laughter. In some districts of Bavaria,
          Thüringen, etc., the man who threshes the last sheaf is said to
          have the Old Woman or the Old Corn-woman; he is tied up in straw,
          carried or carted about the village, and set down at last on the
          dunghill, or taken to the threshing-floor of a neighbouring farmer
          who has not finished his threshing.<a id="noteref_1147" name=

          wound round her neck, a crown of ears is placed on her head, and
          the threshers call out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold the
          Corn-woman.”</span> Here the stranger woman, thus suddenly
          appearing, is taken to be the corn-spirit who has just been

          other cases the farmer's wife represents the corn-spirit. Thus in
          the Commune of Saligné, Canton de Poiret (Vendée), the farmer's
          wife, along with the last sheaf, is tied up in a sheet, placed on a
          litter, and carried to the threshing machine, under which she is
          shoved. Then the woman is drawn out and the sheaf is threshed by
          itself, but the woman is tossed in the sheet (in imitation of

          would be impossible to express more clearly the identification of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these customs
          the spirit of the ripe corn is regarded as old, or at least as of
          mature age. Hence the names of Mother, Grandmother, Old Woman, etc.
          But in other cases the corn-spirit is conceived as young, sometimes
          as a child who is separated from its mother by the stroke of the
          sickle. This last view appears in the Polish custom of calling out
          to the man who cuts the last handful of corn, <span class=

          some districts of West Prussia the figure made out of the last
          sheaf is called the Bastard, and a boy is wrapt up in it. The woman
          who binds the last sheaf <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg

          and represents the Corn-mother, is told that she is about to be
          brought to bed; she cries like a woman in travail, and an old woman
          in the character of grandmother acts as midwife. At last a cry is
          raised that the child is born; whereupon the boy who is tied up in
          the sheaf whimpers and squalls like an infant. The grandmother
          wraps a sack, in imitation of swaddling bands, round the pretended
          baby, and it is carried joyfully to the barn, lest it catch cold in
          the open air.<a id="noteref_1153" name="noteref_1153" href=

          other parts of North Germany, the last sheaf, or the puppet made
          out of it, is called the Child, the Harvest Child, etc. In the
          North of England the last handful of corn was cut by the prettiest
          girl and dressed up as the Corn Baby or Kern Baby; it was brought
          home to music, set up in a conspicuous place at the harvest supper,
          and generally kept in the parlour for the rest of the year. The
          girl who cut it was the Harvest Queen.<a id="noteref_1154" name=

          ribbons. It is called the Maiden, and is kept in the farmhouse,
          generally above the chimney, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          some farms on the Gareloch, Dumbartonshire, about sixty years ago
          the last handful of standing corn was called the Maiden. It was
          divided in two, plaited, and then cut with the sickle by a girl,
          who, it was thought, would be lucky and would soon be married. When
          it was cut the reapers gathered together and threw their sickles in
          the air. The Maiden was dressed with ribbons and hung in the
          kitchen near the roof, where it was kept for several years with the
          date attached. Sometimes five or six Maidens might be seen hanging
          at once on hooks. The harvest supper was called the Kirn.<a id=

          other farms on the Gareloch the last handful of corn was called the
          Maidenhead or the Head; it was neatly plaited, sometimes decked
          with ribbons, and hung in the kitchen for a year, when the grain
          was given to the poultry.<a id="noteref_1158" name="noteref_1158"

          Aberdeenshire also the last sheaf (called the clyack sheaf) was
          formerly cut, as it is still cut at Balquhidder, by the youngest
          girl on the field; then it was dressed in woman's clothes, carried
          home in triumph, and kept till Christmas or New Year's morning,
          when it was given to a mare in foal, or, failing such, to the
          oldest cow.<a id="noteref_1160" name="noteref_1160" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1160</span></span></a>
          Lastly, a somewhat maturer, but still youthful age is assigned to
          the corn-spirit by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg
          346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the appellations of Bride, Oats-bride, and Wheat-bride, which in
          Germany and Scotland are sometimes bestowed both on the last sheaf
          and on the woman who binds it.<a id="noteref_1161" name=
          "noteref_1161" href="#note_1161"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1161</span></span></a>
          Sometimes the idea implied in these names is worked out more fully
          by representing the productive powers of vegetation as bride and
          bridegroom. Thus in some parts of Germany a man and woman dressed
          in straw and called the Oats-wife and the Oats-man, or the
          Oats-bride and the Oats-bridegroom dance at the harvest festival;
          then the corn-stalks are plucked from their bodies till they stand
          as bare as a stubble field. In Silesia, the woman who binds the
          last sheaf is called the Wheat-bride or the Oats-bride. With the
          harvest crown on her head, a bridegroom by her side, and attended
          by bridesmaids, she is brought to the farmhouse with all the
          solemnity of a wedding procession.<a id="noteref_1162" name=
          "noteref_1162" href="#note_1162"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The harvest
          customs just described are strikingly analogous to the spring
          customs which we reviewed in the first chapter. (1.) As in the
          spring customs the tree-spirit is represented both by a tree and by
          a person,<a id="noteref_1163" name="noteref_1163" href=
          "#note_1163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1163</span></span></a> so
          in the harvest customs the corn-spirit is represented both by the
          last sheaf and by the person who cuts or binds or threshes it. The
          equivalence of the person to the sheaf is shown by giving him or
          her the same name as the sheaf, or <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
          versâ</span></span>; by wrapping him or her in the sheaf; and by
          the rule observed in some places, that when the sheaf is called the
          Mother, it must be cut by the oldest married woman; but when it is
          called <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg
          347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Maiden, it must be cut by the youngest girl.<a id=
          "noteref_1164" name="noteref_1164" href="#note_1164"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1164</span></span></a> Here
          the age of the personal representative of the corn-spirit
          corresponds with that of the supposed age of the corn-spirit, just
          as the human victims offered by the Mexicans to promote the growth
          of the maize varied with the age of the maize.<a id="noteref_1165"
          name="noteref_1165" href="#note_1165"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1165</span></span></a> For
          in the Mexican, as in the European, custom the human beings were
          probably representatives of the corn-spirit rather than victims
          offered to him. (2.) Again, the same fertilising influence which
          the tree-spirit is supposed to exert over vegetation, cattle, and
          even women<a id="noteref_1166" name="noteref_1166" href=
          "#note_1166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1166</span></span></a> is
          ascribed to the corn-spirit. Thus, its supposed influence on
          vegetation is shown by the practice of taking some of the grain of
          the last sheaf (in which the corn-spirit is regularly supposed to
          be present), and scattering it among the young corn in
          spring.<a id="noteref_1167" name="noteref_1167" href=
          "#note_1167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1167</span></span></a> Its
          influence on cattle is shown by giving the straw of the last sheaf
          to the cattle at Christmas with the express intention of making
          them thrive.<a id="noteref_1168" name="noteref_1168" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1168</span></span></a>
          Lastly, its influence on women is indicated by the custom of
          delivering the Mother-sheaf, made into the likeness of a pregnant
          woman, to the farmer's wife;<a id="noteref_1169" name=
          "noteref_1169" href="#note_1169"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1169</span></span></a> by
          the belief that the woman who binds the last sheaf will have a
          child next year;<a id="noteref_1170" name="noteref_1170" href=
          "#note_1170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1170</span></span></a>
          perhaps, too, by the idea that the person who gets it will marry
          next year.<a id="noteref_1171" name="noteref_1171" href=
          "#note_1171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plainly,
          therefore, these spring and harvest customs are based on the same
          ancient modes of thought, and form parts of the same primitive
          heathendom, which was doubtless practised by our forefathers long
          before the dawn of history, as it is practised to this day by
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name=
          "Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> many of their
          descendants. Amongst the marks of a primitive religion, we may note
          the following:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1.) No special
          class of persons is set apart for the performance of the rites; in
          other words, there are no priests. The rites may be performed by
          any one, as occasion demands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2.) No special
          places are set apart for the performance of the rites; in other
          words, there are no temples. The rites may be performed anywhere,
          as occasion demands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3.) Spirits,
          not gods, are recognised. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a.</span></span>) As distinguished from gods,
          spirits are restricted in their operations to definite departments
          of nature. Their names are general, not proper. Their attributes
          are generic, rather than individual; in other words, there is an
          indefinite number of spirits of each class, and the individuals of
          a class are all much alike; they have no definitely marked
          individuality; no accepted traditions are current as to their
          origin, life, adventures, and character. (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b.</span></span>) On
          the other hand gods, as distinguished from spirits, are not
          exclusively restricted in their operations to definite departments
          of nature. It is true that there is generally some one department
          over which they preside as their special province; but they are not
          rigorously confined to it; they can exert their power for good or
          evil in many other spheres of nature and life. Again, they bear
          individual or proper names, such as Ceres, Proserpine, Bacchus; and
          their individual characters and histories are fixed by current
          myths and the representations of art.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4.) The rites
          are magical rather than propitiatory. In other words, the desired
          objects are attained, not by propitiating the favour of divine
          beings through sacrifice, prayer, and praise, but by ceremonies
          which, as has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg
          349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          been explained,<a id="noteref_1172" name="noteref_1172" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1172</span></span></a> are
          believed to influence the course of nature directly through a
          physical sympathy or resemblance between the rite and the effect
          which it is the intention of the rite to produce.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judged by these
          tests, the spring and harvest customs of our European peasantry
          deserve to rank as primitive. For no special class of persons and
          no special places are set exclusively apart for their performance;
          they may be performed by any one, master or man, mistress or maid,
          boy or girl; they are practised, not in temples or churches, but in
          the woods and meadows, beside brooks, in barns, on harvest fields
          and cottage floors. The supernatural beings whose existence is
          taken for granted in them are spirits rather than deities; their
          functions are limited to certain well-defined departments of
          nature; their names are general, like the Barley-mother, the Old
          Woman, the Maiden, not proper names like Ceres, Proserpine,
          Bacchus. Their generic attributes are known, but their individual
          histories and characters are not the subject of myths. For they
          exist in classes rather than as individuals, and the members of
          each class are indistinguishable. For example, every farm has its
          Corn-mother, or its Old Woman, or its Maiden; but every Corn-mother
          is much like every other Corn-mother, and so with the Old Women and
          Maidens. Lastly, in these harvest, as in the spring, customs, the
          ritual is magical rather than propitiatory. This is shown by
          throwing the Corn-mother into the river in order to secure rain and
          dew for the crops;<a id="noteref_1173" name="noteref_1173" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, the
          custom of keeping the puppet—the representative of the
          corn-spirit—till next harvest, is a charm to maintain the

          veneration, saying it is the mother of the mays of their
          inheritances, and that by this means the mays augments and is
          preserved. In this moneth [the sixth month, answering to May] they
          make a particular sacrifice, and the witches demaund of this
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          then they carry this Mays to the farme to burne, whence they
          brought it, according to every man's power; then they make another
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          saying that they renue it, to the end the seede of Mays may not

          longer, they leave it untill the next yeare. This foolish vanity
          continueth to this day, and it is very common amongest the Indians
          to have these <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          There seems to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg
          351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          be some error in this description of the custom. Probably it was
          the dressed-up bunch of maize, not the granary (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pirua</span></span>), which was worshipped by
          the Peruvians and regarded as the Mother of the Maize. This is
          confirmed by what we know of the Peruvian custom from another
          source. The Peruvians, we are told, believed all useful plants to
          be animated by a divine being who causes their growth. According to
          the particular plant, these divine beings were called the
          Maize-mother (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Zara-mama</span></span>), the Quinoa-mother
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Quinoa-mama</span></span>), the Cocoa-mother
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Coca-mama</span></span>), and the
          Potato-mother (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Axo-mama</span></span>). Figures of these
          divine mothers were made respectively of ears of maize and leaves
          of the quinoa and cocoa plants; they were dressed in women's
          clothes and worshipped. Thus the Maize-mother was represented by a
          puppet made of stalks of maize, dressed in full female attire; and
          the Indians believed that <span class="tei tei-q">“as mother, it
          had the power of producing and giving birth to much
          maize.”</span><a id="noteref_1179" name="noteref_1179" href=

          Probably, therefore, Acosta misunderstood his informant, and the
          Mother of the Maize which he describes was not the granary
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pirua</span></span>) but the bunch of maize
          dressed in rich vestments. The Peruvian Mother of the Maize, like
          the harvest Maiden at Balquhidder, was kept for a year in order
          that by her means the corn might grow and multiply. But lest her
          strength might not suffice to last out the year, she was asked in
          the course of the year how she felt, and if she answered that she
          felt weak, she was burned and a fresh Mother of the Maize made,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to the end the seede of Mays <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> may not perish.”</span> Here, it may be
          observed, we have a strong confirmation of the explanation already
          given of the custom of killing the god, both periodically and
          occasionally. The Mother of the Maize was allowed, as a rule, to
          live through a year, that being the period during which her
          strength might reasonably be supposed to last unimpaired; but on
          any symptom of her strength failing she was put to death and a
          fresh and vigorous Mother of the Maize took her place, lest the
          maize which depended on her for its existence should languish and
          decay.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hardly less
          clearly does the same train of thought come out in the harvest
          customs formerly observed by the Zapotecs of Mexico. At harvest the
          priests, attended by the nobles and people, went in procession to
          the maize fields, where they picked out the largest and finest
          sheaf. This they took with great ceremony to the town or village,
          and placed it in the temple upon an altar adorned with wild
          flowers. After sacrificing to the harvest god, the priests
          carefully wrapt up the sheaf in fine linen and kept it till
          seed-time. Then the priests and nobles met again at the temple, one
          of them bringing the skin of a wild beast, elaborately ornamented,
          in which the linen cloth containing the sheaf was enveloped. The
          sheaf was then carried once more in procession to the field from
          which it had been taken. Here a small cavity or subterranean
          chamber had been prepared, in which the precious sheaf was
          deposited, wrapt in its various envelopes. After sacrifice had been
          offered to the gods of the fields for an abundant crop, the chamber
          was closed and covered over with earth. Immediately thereafter the
          sowing began. Finally, when the time of harvest drew near, the
          buried sheaf was solemnly disinterred by the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> priests, who distributed the grain to
          all who asked for it. The packets of grain so distributed were
          carefully preserved as talismans till the harvest.<a id=

          these ceremonies, which continued to be annually celebrated long
          after the Spanish conquest, the intention of keeping the finest
          sheaf buried in the maize field from seed-time to harvest was
          undoubtedly to quicken the growth of the maize.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the reader
          still feels any doubts as to the original meaning of the harvest
          customs practised by our peasantry, these doubts may be dispelled
          by comparing the harvest customs of the Dyaks of Borneo. At harvest
          the Dyaks of Northern Borneo have a special feast, the object of
          which is <span class="tei tei-q">“to secure the soul of the rice,
          which if not so detained, the produce of their farms would speedily
          rot and decay.”</span> The mode of securing the soul of the rice
          varies in different tribes. Sometimes the priest catches it, in the
          form of a few grains of rice, in a white cloth. Sometimes a large
          shed is erected outside the village, and near it <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is reared a high and spacious altar.
          The corner-posts of the altar are lofty bamboos with leafy tops,
          from one of which there hangs a long narrow streamer of white
          cloth. Here gaily-dressed men and women dance with slow and solemn
          steps. Suddenly the elders and priests rush at the white streamer,
          seize the end of it, and begin dancing and swaying to and fro, amid
          a burst of wild music and the yells of the spectators. An elder
          leaps on the altar and shakes the bamboos violently, whereupon
          small stones, bunches of hair and grains of rice fall at the feet
          of the dancers and are carefully picked up by attendants. These
          grains of rice are the soul of the rice. At sowing-time some of
          this soul of the rice is planted with the other seeds, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and is thus propagated and communicated.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_1182" name="noteref_1182" href="#note_1182"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1182</span></span></a> The
          same need of securing the soul of the rice, if the crop is to
          thrive, is keenly felt by the Karens of Burma. When a rice-field
          does not flourish, they suppose that the soul (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kelah</span></span>) of the rice is in some
          way detained from the rice. If the soul cannot be called back, the
          crop will fail. The following formula is used in recalling the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kelah</span></span> (soul) of the rice:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O come, rice-<span class=

          Come from the sources of rivers and their mouths. Come from the

          Again, the European custom of representing the corn-spirit in the
          double form of bride and bridegroom<a id="noteref_1184" name=
          "noteref_1184" href="#note_1184"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1184</span></span></a> is
          paralleled by a custom observed at the rice-harvest in Java. Before
          the reapers begin to cut the rice, the priest or sorcerer picks out
          a number of ears of rice, which are tied together, smeared with
          ointment, and adorned with flowers. Thus decked out, the ears are
          called the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">padi-pëngantèn</span></span>, that is, the
          Rice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom; their wedding feast is
          celebrated, and the cutting of the rice begins immediately
          afterwards. Later on, when the rice is being got in, a bridal
          chamber is partitioned off in the barn, and furnished with a new
          mat, a lamp, and all kinds of toilet articles. Sheaves of rice, to
          represent the wedding guests, are placed beside the Rice-bride and
          the Rice-bridegroom. Not till this has been done may the whole
          harvest be housed in the barn. And for the first forty days after
          the rice has been housed, no one may enter the barn, for fear of
          disturbing the newly-wedded pair.<a id="noteref_1185" name=
          "noteref_1185" href="#note_1185"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Compared with
          the Corn-mother of Germany and the harvest Maiden of Balquhidder,
          the Demeter and Proserpine of Greece are late products of religious
          growth. But, as Aryans, the Greeks must at one time or another have
          observed harvest customs like those which are still practised by
          Celts, Teutons, and Slavs, and which, far beyond the limits of the
          Aryan world, have been practised by the Incas of Peru, the Dyaks of
          Borneo, and the Malays of Java—a sufficient proof that the ideas on
          which these customs rest are not confined to any one race, but
          naturally suggest themselves <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to all untutored peoples engaged in
          agriculture. It is probable, therefore, that Demeter and
          Proserpine, those stately and beautiful figures of Greek mythology,
          grew out of the same simple beliefs and practices which still
          prevail among our modern peasantry, and that they were represented
          by rude dolls made out of the yellow sheaves on many a
          harvest-field long before their breathing images were wrought in
          bronze and marble by the master hands of Phidias and Praxiteles. A
          reminiscence of that olden time—a scent, so to say, of the
          harvest-field—lingered to the last in the title of the Maiden
          (<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Kore</span></span>) by which Proserpine was
          commonly known. Thus if the prototype of Demeter is the Corn-mother
          of Germany, the prototype of Proserpine is the harvest Maiden,
          which, autumn after autumn, is still made from the last sheaf on
          the Braes of Balquhidder. Indeed if we knew more about the
          peasant-farmers of ancient Greece we should probably find that even
          in classical times they continued annually to fashion their
          Corn-mothers (Demeters) and Maidens (Proserpines) out of the ripe
          corn on the harvest fields. But unfortunately the Demeter and
          Proserpine whom we know are the denizens of towns, the majestic
          inhabitants of lordly temples; it was for such divinities alone
          that the refined writers of antiquity had eyes; the rude rites
          performed by rustics amongst the corn were beneath their notice.
          Even if they noticed them, they probably never dreamed of any
          connection between the puppet of corn-stalks on the sunny
          stubble-field and the marble divinity in the shady coolness of the
          temple. Still the writings even of these town-bred and cultured
          persons afford us an occasional glimpse of a Demeter as rude as the
          rudest that a remote German village <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> can show. Thus the story that Iasion begat a
          child Plutus (<span class="tei tei-q">“wealth,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“abundance”</span>) by Demeter on a thrice-ploughed
          field,<a id="noteref_1186" name="noteref_1186" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1186</span></span></a> may
          be compared with the West Prussian custom of the mock birth of a
          child on the harvest field.<a id="noteref_1187" name="noteref_1187"
          href="#note_1187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1187</span></span></a> In
          this Prussian custom the pretended mother represents the
          Corn-mother (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Žytniamatka</span></span>);
          the pretended child represents the Corn-baby, and the whole
          ceremony is a charm to ensure a crop next year.<a id="noteref_1188"
          name="noteref_1188" href="#note_1188"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1188</span></span></a>
          There are other folk-customs, observed both in spring and at
          harvest, with which the legend of the begetting of the child Plutus
          is probably still more intimately connected. Their general purport
          is to impart fertility to the fields by performing, or at least
          mimicking, upon them the process of procreation.<a id=
          "noteref_1189" name="noteref_1189" href="#note_1189"><span class=

          Another glimpse of the savage under the civilised Demeter will be
          afforded farther on, when we come to deal with another aspect of
          these agricultural divinities.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader may
          have observed that in modern folk-customs the corn-spirit is
          generally represented either by a Corn-mother (Old Woman, etc.) or
          by a Maiden (Corn-baby, etc.), not both by a Corn-mother
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name=
          "Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and by a Maiden. Why
          then did the Greeks represent the corn both as a mother and a
          daughter? In the Breton custom the mother-sheaf—a large figure made
          out of the last sheaf with a small corn-doll inside of it—clearly
          represents both the Corn-mother and the Corn-daughter, the latter
          still unborn.<a id="noteref_1190" name="noteref_1190" href=
          "#note_1190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1190</span></span></a>
          Again, in the Prussian custom just described, the woman who plays
          the part of Corn-mother represents the ripe corn; the child appears
          to represent next year's corn, which may be regarded, naturally
          enough, as the child of this year's corn, since it is from the seed
          of this year's harvest that next year's corn will spring. Demeter
          would thus be the ripe corn of this year; Proserpine the seed-corn
          taken from it and sown in autumn, to reappear in spring. The
          descent of Proserpine into the lower world<a id="noteref_1191"

          would express the sprouting of the young corn. Thus the Proserpine
          of this year becomes the Demeter of the next, and this may very
          well have been the original form of the myth. But when with the
          advance of religious thought the corn came to be personified, no
          longer as a being that went through the whole cycle of birth,
          growth, reproduction, and death within a year, but as an immortal
          goddess, consistency requires that one of the two personifications,
          the mother or the daughter, should be sacrificed. But the double
          conception of the corn as mother and daughter was too old and too
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name=
          "Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> deeply rooted in the
          popular mind to be eradicated by logic, and so room had to be found
          in the reformed myth both for mother and daughter. This was done by
          assigning to Proserpine the rôle of the corn sown in autumn and
          sprouting in spring, while Demeter was left to play the somewhat
          vague and ill-defined part of mother of the corn, who laments its
          annual disappearance underground, and rejoices over its
          reappearance in spring. Thus instead of a regular succession of
          divine beings, each living a year and then giving birth to her
          successor, the reformed myth exhibits the conception of two divine
          and immortal beings, one of whom annually disappears into and
          reappears from the ground, while the other has little to do but to
          weep and rejoice at the appropriate times.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This explanation
          of the double personification of the corn in Greek myth assumes
          that both personifications (Demeter and Proserpine) are original.
          But if we assume that the Greek myth started with a single
          personification, the after-growth of a second personification may
          perhaps be explained as follows. On looking over the peasant
          harvest customs which have been passed under review, it may be
          noticed that they involve two distinct conceptions of the
          corn-spirit. For whereas in some of the customs the corn-spirit is
          treated as immanent in the corn, in others it is regarded as
          external to it. Thus when a particular sheaf is called by the name
          of the corn-spirit, and is dressed in clothes and treated with
          reverence,<a id="noteref_1193" name="noteref_1193" href=
          "#note_1193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1193</span></span></a> the
          corn-spirit is clearly regarded as immanent in the corn. But when
          the corn-spirit is said to make <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the corn grow by passing through it, or to
          blight the corn of those against whom she has a grudge,<a id=
          "noteref_1194" name="noteref_1194" href="#note_1194"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1194</span></span></a> she
          is clearly conceived as quite separate from, though exercising
          power over, the corn. Conceived in the latter way the corn-spirit
          is in a fair way to become a deity of the corn, if she has not
          become so already. Of these two conceptions, that of the
          corn-spirit as immanent in the corn is doubtless the older, since
          the view of nature as animated by indwelling spirits appears to
          have generally preceded the view of it as controlled by deities
          external to it; to put it shortly, animism precedes deism. In the
          harvest customs of our European peasantry the conception of the
          corn-spirit as immanent appears to be the prevalent one; the
          conception of it as external occurs rather as an exception. In
          Greek mythology, on the other hand, Demeter is distinctly conceived
          in the latter way; she is the deity of the corn rather than the
          spirit immanent in it.<a id="noteref_1195" name="noteref_1195"
          href="#note_1195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1195</span></span></a> The
          process of thought which seems to be chiefly instrumental in
          producing the transition from the one mode of conception to the
          other is anthropomorphism, or the gradual investment of the
          immanent spirits with more and more of the attributes of humanity.
          As men emerge from savagery the tendency to anthropomorphise or
          humanise their divinities gains strength; and the more
          anthropomorphic these become, the wider is the breach which severs
          them from those natural objects of which they were at first merely
          the animating spirits or souls. But in the progress upwards from
          savagery, men of the same generation do not march abreast; and
          though the anthropomorphic gods may satisfy the religious wants
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name=
          "Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of more advanced
          individuals, the more backward members of the community will cling
          by preference to the older animistic notions. Now when the spirit
          of any natural object (as the corn) has been invested with human
          qualities, detached from the object, and converted into a deity
          controlling it, the object itself is, by the withdrawal of its
          spirit, left inanimate, it becomes, so to say, a spiritual vacuum.
          But the popular fancy, intolerant of such a vacuum, in other words,
          unable to conceive anything as inanimate, immediately creates a
          fresh mythical being, with which it peoples the vacant object. Thus
          the same natural object is now represented in mythology by two
          separate beings; first, by the old spirit now separated from it and
          raised to the rank of a deity; second, by the new spirit, freshly
          created by the popular fancy to supply the place vacated by the old
          spirit on its elevation to a higher sphere. The problem for
          mythology now is, having got two separate personifications of the
          same object, what to do with them? How are their relations to each
          other to be adjusted, and room found for both in the mythological
          system? When the old spirit or new deity is conceived as creating
          or producing the object in question, the problem is easily solved.
          Since the object is believed to be produced by the old spirit, and
          animated by the new one, the latter, as the soul of the object,
          must also owe its existence to the former; thus the old spirit will
          stand to the new one as producer to produced, that is (in
          mythology), as parent to child, and if both spirits are conceived
          as female, their relation will be that of mother and daughter. In
          this way, starting from a single personification of the corn as
          female, mythology might in time reach a double personification of
          it as mother and daughter. It would be very rash <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to affirm that this was the way in
          which the myth of Demeter and Proserpine actually took shape; but
          it seems a legitimate conjecture that the reduplication of deities,
          of which Demeter and Proserpine furnish an example, may sometimes
          have arisen in the way indicated. For example, among the pairs of
          deities whom we have been considering, it has been shown that there
          are grounds for regarding both Isis and her companion god Osiris as
          personifications of the corn.<a id="noteref_1196" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1196</span></span></a> On
          the hypothesis just suggested, Isis would be the old corn-spirit,
          and Osiris would be the newer one, whose relationship to the old
          spirit was variously explained as that of brother, husband, and
          son;<a id="noteref_1197" name="noteref_1197" href=
          "#note_1197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1197</span></span></a> for
          of course mythology would always be free to account for the
          coexistence of the two divinities in more ways than one. Further,
          this hypothesis offers at least a possible explanation of the
          relation of Virbius to the Arician Diana. The latter, as we have
          seen,<a id="noteref_1198" name="noteref_1198" href=
          "#note_1198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1198</span></span></a> was
          a tree-goddess; and if, as I have conjectured, the Flamen Virbialis
          was no other than the priest of Nemi himself, that is, the King of
          the Wood, Virbius must also have been a tree-spirit. On the present
          hypothesis he was the newer tree-spirit, whose relation to the old
          tree-spirit (Diana) was explained by representing him as her
          favourite or lover. It must not, however, be forgotten that this
          proposed explanation of such pairs of deities as Demeter and
          Proserpine, Isis and Osiris, Diana and Virbius, is purely
          conjectural, and is only given for what it is worth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preceding
          pages an attempt has been made to show that in the Corn-mother and
          harvest Maiden of Northern Europe we have the prototypes of Demeter
          and Proserpine. But an essential feature is still wanting to
          complete the resemblance. A leading incident in the Greek myth is
          the death and resurrection of Proserpine; it is this incident
          which, coupled with the nature of the goddess as a deity of
          vegetation, links the myth with the cults of Adonis, Attis, Osiris,
          and Dionysus; and it is in virtue of this incident that the myth is
          considered in this chapter. It remains, therefore, to see whether
          the conception of the annual death and resurrection of a god, which
          figures so prominently in these great Greek and Oriental worships,
          has not also its origin in the rustic rites observed by reapers and
          vine-dressers amongst the corn-shocks and the vines.</p>

          ignorance of the popular superstitions and customs of the ancients
          has already been confessed. But the obscurity which thus hangs over
          the first beginnings of ancient religion is fortunately dissipated
          to some extent in the present case. The worships of Osiris, Adonis,
          and Attis had their respective seats, as we have seen, in Egypt,
          Syria, and Phrygia; and in each of these countries certain harvest
          and vintage customs are known to have been observed, the
          resemblance of which to each other and to the national rites struck
          the ancients themselves, and, compared with the harvest customs of
          modern peasants and barbarians, seem to throw some light on the
          origin of the rites in question.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          already mentioned, on the authority of Diodorus, that in ancient
          Egypt the reapers were wont to lament over the first sheaf cut,
          invoking Isis as the goddess to whom they owed the discovery of
          corn.<a id="noteref_1199" name="noteref_1199" href=

          the plaintive song or cry sung or uttered by Egyptian reapers the
          Greeks gave the name of Maneros, and explained the name by a story
          that Maneros, the only son of the first Egyptian king, invented
          agriculture, and, dying an untimely death, was thus lamented by the
          people.<a id="noteref_1200" name="noteref_1200" href=

          appears, however, that the name Maneros is due to a

          reapers over the cut corn as a dirge for the death of the
          corn-spirit (Isis or Osiris) and a prayer for its return. As the
          cry was raised over the first ears reaped, it would seem that the
          corn-spirit was believed by the Egyptians to be present in the
          first corn cut and to die under the sickle. We have seen that in
          Java the first ears of rice are taken to represent the Corn-bride
          and the Corn-bridegroom.<a id="noteref_1202" name="noteref_1202"

          the holy pictures; afterwards it is threshed separately, and some
          of its grain is mixed with the next year's seed-corn.<a id=

          corn-reapers, was sung at the vintage and probably (to judge by
          analogy) also at harvest. This Phoenician song was called by the
          Greeks Linus or Ailinus and explained, like Maneros, as a lament

          One summer day, watching the reapers at work in his fields, he went
          to fetch them a drink of water and was never heard of more. So the

          corresponding song, sung by harvesters both at reaping and at
          threshing, was called Lityerses. According to one story, Lityerses
          was a bastard son of Midas, King of Phrygia. He used to reap the
          corn, and had an enormous appetite. When a stranger happened to
          enter the corn-field or to pass <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          drink, then took him to the corn-fields on the banks of the
          Maeander and compelled him to reap along with him. Lastly, he used
          to wrap the stranger in a sheaf, cut off his head with a sickle,
          and carry away his body, wrapt in the corn stalks. But at last he
          was himself slain by Hercules, who threw his body into the

          Hercules was probably reported to have slain Lityerses in the same
          way that Lityerses slew others (as Theseus treated Sinis and
          Sciron), we may infer that Lityerses used to throw the bodies of
          his victims into the river. According to another version of the
          story, Lityerses, a son of Midas, used to challenge people to a
          reaping match with him, and if he vanquished them he used to thrash
          them; but one day he met with a stronger reaper, who slew
          him.<a id="noteref_1210" name="noteref_1210" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are some
          grounds for supposing that in these stories of Lityerses we have
          the description of a Phrygian harvest custom in accordance with
          which certain persons, especially strangers passing the harvest
          field, were regularly regarded as embodiments of the corn-spirit
          and as such were seized by the reapers, wrapt in sheaves, and
          beheaded, their bodies, bound up in the corn-stalks, being
          afterwards thrown into water as a rain-charm. The grounds for this
          supposition are, first, the resemblance of the Lityerses story to
          the harvest customs of European peasantry, and, second, the fact
          that human beings have been commonly killed by savage races to
          promote the fertility of the fields. We <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> will examine these grounds successively,
          beginning with the former.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In comparing the
          story with the harvest customs of Europe,<a id="noteref_1211" name=
          "noteref_1211" href="#note_1211"><span class=

          three points deserve special attention, namely: I. the reaping
          match and the binding of persons in the sheaves; II. the killing of
          the corn-spirit or his representatives; III. the treatment of
          visitors to the harvest-field or of strangers passing it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I. In regard to
          the first head, we have seen that in modern Europe the person who
          cuts or binds or threshes the last sheaf is often exposed to rough
          treatment at the hands of his fellow-labourers. For example, he is
          bound up in the last sheaf, and, thus encased, is carried or carted
          about, beaten, drenched with water, thrown on a dunghill, etc. Or,
          if he is spared this horseplay, he is at least the subject of
          ridicule or is believed destined to suffer some misfortune in the
          course of the year. Hence the harvesters are naturally reluctant to
          give the last cut at reaping or the last stroke at threshing or to
          bind the last sheaf, and towards the close of the work this
          reluctance produces an emulation among the labourers, each striving
          to finish his task as fast as possible, in order that he may escape
          the invidious distinction of being last.<a id="noteref_1212" name=
          "noteref_1212" href="#note_1212"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1212</span></span></a> For
          example, in the neighbourhood of Danzig, when the winter corn is
          cut and mostly bound up in sheaves, the portion which still remains
          to be bound is divided amongst the women binders, each of whom
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name=
          "Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> receives a swath of
          equal length to bind. A crowd of reapers, children, and idlers
          gathers round to witness the contest, and at the word, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Seize the Old Man,”</span> the women fall to work, all
          binding their allotted swaths as hard as they can. The spectators
          watch them narrowly, and the woman who cannot keep pace with the
          rest and consequently binds the last sheaf has to carry the Old Man
          (that is, the last sheaf made up in the form of a man) to the
          farmhouse and deliver it to the farmer with the words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Here I bring you the Old Man.”</span> At the supper
          which follows, the Old Man is placed at the table and receives an
          abundant portion of food which, as he cannot eat it, falls to the
          share of the woman who carried him. Afterwards the Old Man is
          placed in the yard and all the people dance round him. Or the woman
          who bound the last sheaf dances for a good while with the Old Man,
          while the rest form a ring round them; afterwards they all, one
          after the other, dance a single round with him. Further, the woman
          who bound the last sheaf goes herself by the name of the Old Man
          till the next harvest, and is often mocked with the cry,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Here comes the Old Man.”</span><a id=
          "noteref_1213" name="noteref_1213" href="#note_1213"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1213</span></span></a> At
          Aschbach, Bavaria, when the reaping is nearly finished, the reapers
          say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now we will drive out the Old
          Man.”</span> Each of them sets himself to reap a patch of corn and
          reaps as fast as he can; he who cuts the last handful or the last
          stalk is greeted by the rest with an exulting cry, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You have the Old Man.”</span> Sometimes a black mask
          is fastened on the reaper's face and he is dressed in woman's
          clothes; or if the reaper is a woman, she is dressed in man's
          clothes; a dance follows. At the supper the Old Man gets twice as
          large a portion of food as the others. At threshing, the
          proceedings are the same; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg
          369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the person who gives the last stroke is said to have the Old
          Man.<a id="noteref_1214" name="noteref_1214" href=
          "#note_1214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These examples
          illustrate the contests in reaping, threshing, and binding which
          take place amongst the harvesters, on account of their
          unwillingness to suffer the ridicule and personal inconvenience
          attaching to the individual who happens to finish his work last. It
          will be remembered that the person who is last at reaping, binding,
          or threshing, is regarded as the representative of the
          corn-spirit,<a id="noteref_1215" name="noteref_1215" href=
          "#note_1215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1215</span></span></a> and
          this idea is more fully expressed by binding him or her in
          corn-stalks. The latter custom has been already illustrated, but a
          few more instances may be added. At Kloxin, near Stettin, the
          harvesters call out to the woman who binds the last sheaf,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You have the Old Man, and must keep
          him.”</span> The Old Man is a great bundle of corn decked with
          flowers and ribbons, and fashioned into a rude semblance of the
          human form. It is fastened on a rake or strapped on a horse, and
          brought with music to the village. In delivering the Old Man to the
          farmer, the woman says—</p>

          flowers, and flowers and a helmet of straw are placed on her head.
          In solemn procession she carries the harvest-crown to the squire,
          over whose head she holds it while she utters a string of good
          wishes. At the dance which follows, the Old Man has the right to

          to finish his task; for the Old Rye-woman lives in the last stalks,
          and whoever cuts the last stalks kills the Old Rye-woman, and by
          killing her he brings trouble on himself.<a id="noteref_1232" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1232</span></span></a> In
          Wilkischken (district of Tilsit) the man who cuts the last corn
          goes by the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“The killer of the
          Rye-woman.”</span><a id="noteref_1233" name="noteref_1233" href=

          Lithuania, again, the corn-spirit is believed to be killed at
          threshing as well as at reaping. When only a single pile of corn
          remains to be threshed, all the threshers suddenly step back a few
          paces, as if at the word of command. Then they fall to work plying
          their flails with the utmost rapidity and vehemence, till they come
          to the last bundle. Upon this they fling themselves with almost
          frantic fury, straining every nerve, and raining blows on it till
          the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Halt!”</span> rings out sharply
          from the leader. The man whose flail is the last to fall after the
          command to stop has been given is immediately surrounded by all the
          rest, crying out that <span class="tei tei-q">“He has struck the
          Old Rye-woman dead.”</span> He has to expiate the deed by treating
          them to brandy; and, like the man who cuts the last corn, he is
          known as <span class="tei tei-q">“The killer of the Old
          Rye-woman.”</span><a id="noteref_1234" name="noteref_1234" href=

          Sometimes in Lithuania the slain corn-spirit was represented by a
          puppet. Thus a female figure was made out of corn-stalks, dressed
          in clothes, and placed on the threshing-floor, under the heap of
          corn which was to be threshed last. Whoever thereafter gave the
          last stroke at threshing <span class="tei tei-q">“struck the Old
          Woman dead.”</span><a id="noteref_1235" name="noteref_1235" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1235</span></span></a> We
          have already had examples of burning the figure which represents
          the corn-spirit.<a id="noteref_1236" name="noteref_1236" href=

          Sometimes, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg
          374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          again, the corn-spirit is represented by a man, who lies down under
          the last corn; it is threshed upon his body, and the people say
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Old Man is being beaten to
          death.”</span><a id="noteref_1237" name="noteref_1237" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1237</span></span></a> We
          have already seen that sometimes the farmer's wife is thrust,
          together with the last sheaf, under the threshing-machine, as if to
          thresh her, and that afterwards a pretence is made of winnowing
          her.<a id="noteref_1238" name="noteref_1238" href=

          Volders, in the Tyrol, husks of corn are stuck behind the neck of
          the man who gives the last stroke at threshing, and he is throttled
          with a straw garland. If he is tall, it is believed that the corn
          will be tall next year. Then he is tied on a bundle and flung into
          the river.<a id="noteref_1239" name="noteref_1239" href=

          Carinthia, the thresher who gave the last stroke, and the person
          who untied the last sheaf on the threshing-floor, are bound hand
          and foot with straw bands, and crowns of straw are placed on their
          heads. Then they are tied, face to face, on a sledge, dragged
          through the village, and flung into a brook.<a id="noteref_1240"

          custom of throwing the representative of the corn-spirit into a
          stream, like that of drenching him with water, is, as usual, a
          rain-charm.<a id="noteref_1241" name="noteref_1241" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">III. Thus far
          the representatives of the corn-spirit have generally been the man
          or woman who cuts, binds, or threshes the last corn. We now come to
          the cases in which the corn-spirit is represented either by a
          stranger passing the harvest-field (as in the Lityerses tale), or
          by a visitor entering it for the first time. All over Germany it is
          customary for the reapers or threshers to lay hold of passing
          strangers and bind them with a rope made of corn-stalks, till
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name=
          "Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they pay a forfeit;
          and when the farmer himself or one of his guests enters the field
          or the threshing-floor for the first time, he is treated in the
          same way. Sometimes the rope is only tied round his arm or his feet
          or his neck.<a id="noteref_1242" name="noteref_1242" href=
          "#note_1242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1242</span></span></a> But
          sometimes he is regularly swathed in corn. Thus at Solör in Norway,
          whoever enters the field, be he the master or a stranger, is tied
          up in a sheaf and must pay a ransom. In the neighbourhood of Soest,
          when the farmer visits the flax-pullers for the first time, he is
          completely enveloped in flax. Passers-by are also surrounded by the
          women, tied up in flax, and compelled to stand brandy.<a id=
          "noteref_1243" name="noteref_1243" href="#note_1243"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1243</span></span></a> At
          Nördlingen strangers are caught with straw ropes and tied up in a
          sheaf till they pay a forfeit. At Brie, Isle de France, when any
          one who does not belong to the farm passes by the harvest-field,
          the reapers give chase. If they catch him, they bind him in a sheaf
          and bite him, one after the other, in the forehead, crying
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You shall carry the key of the
          field.”</span><a id="noteref_1244" name="noteref_1244" href=
          "#note_1244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1244</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“To have the key”</span> is an expression
          used by harvesters elsewhere in the sense of to cut or bind or
          thresh the last sheaf;<a id="noteref_1245" name="noteref_1245"
          href="#note_1245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1245</span></span></a>
          hence, it is equivalent to the phrases <span class="tei tei-q">“You
          have the Old Man,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You are the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name=
          "Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Old Man,”</span>
          which are addressed to the cutter, binder, or thresher of the last
          sheaf. Therefore, when a stranger, as at Brie, is tied up in a
          sheaf and told that he will <span class="tei tei-q">“carry the key
          of the field,”</span> it is as much as to say that he is the Old
          Man, that is, an embodiment of the corn-spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, like
          Lityerses, modern reapers lay hold of a passing stranger and tie
          him up in a sheaf. It is not to be expected that they should
          complete the parallel by cutting off his head; but if they do not
          take such a strong step, their language and gestures are at least
          indicative of a desire to do so. For instance, in Mecklenburg on
          the first clay of reaping, if the master or mistress or a stranger
          enters the field, or merely passes by it, all the mowers face
          towards him and sharpen their scythes, clashing their whet-stones
          against them in unison, as if they were making ready to mow. Then
          the woman who leads the mowers steps up to him and ties a band
          round his left arm. He must ransom himself by payment of a
          forfeit.<a id="noteref_1246" name="noteref_1246" href=
          "#note_1246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1246</span></span></a> Near
          Ratzeburg when the master or other person of mark enters the field
          or passes by it, all the harvesters stop work and march towards him
          in a body, the men with their scythes in front. On meeting him they
          form up in line, men and women. The men stick the poles of their
          scythes in the ground, as they do in whetting them; then they take
          off their caps and hang them on the scythes, while their leader
          stands forward and makes a speech. When he has done, they all whet
          their scythes in measured time very loudly, after which they put on
          their caps. Two of the women binders then come forward; one of them
          ties the master or stranger (as the case may be) with corn-ears
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name=
          "Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or with a silken
          band; the other delivers a rhyming address. The following are
          specimens of the speeches made by the reaper on these occasions. In
          some parts of Pomerania every passer-by is stopped, his way being
          barred with a corn-rope. The reapers form a circle round him and
          sharpen their scythes, while their leader says—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That in these
          customs the whetting of the scythes is really meant as a
          preliminary to mowing appears from the following variation of the
          preceding customs. In the district of Lüneburg when any one enters
          the harvest-field, he is asked whether he will engage a good
          fellow. If he says yes, the harvesters mow some swaths, yelling and
          screaming, and then ask him for drink-money.<a id="noteref_1249"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> accordingly. At Wiedingharde in Schleswig
          when a stranger comes to the threshing-floor he is asked
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I teach you the flail-dance?”</span>
          If he says yes, they put the arms of the threshing-flail round his
          neck (as if he were a sheaf of corn), and press them together so
          tightly that he is nearly choked.<a id="noteref_1250" name=

          some parishes of Wermland (Sweden) when a stranger enters the

          <span class="tei tei-q">“they will teach him the
          threshing-song.”</span> Then they put a flail round his neck and a
          straw rope about his body. Also, as we have seen, if a stranger
          woman enters the threshing-floor, the threshers put a flail round
          her body and a wreath of corn-stalks round her neck, and call out,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“See the Corn-woman! See! that is how the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          customs, observed both on the harvest-field and on the
          threshing-floor, a passing stranger is regarded as a
          personification of the corn, in other words, as the corn-spirit;
          and a show is made of treating him like the corn by mowing,
          binding, and threshing him. If the reader still doubts whether
          European peasants can really regard a passing stranger in this
          light, the following custom should set their doubts at rest. During
          the madder-harvest in the Dutch province of Zealand a stranger
          passing by a field where the people are digging the madder-roots
          will sometimes call out to them <span lang="nl" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="nl"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Koortspillers</span></span> (a term of
          reproach). Upon this, two of the fleetest runners <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> make after him, and, if they catch him,
          they bring him back to the madder-field and bury him in the earth
          up to his middle at least, jeering at him the while; then they ease
          nature before his face.<a id="noteref_1252" name="noteref_1252"
          href="#note_1252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1252</span></span></a> This
          last act is to be explained as follows. The spirit of the corn and
          of other cultivated plants is sometimes conceived, not as immanent
          in the plant, but as its owner; hence the cutting of the corn at
          harvest, the digging of the roots, and the gathering of fruit from
          the fruit-trees are each and all of them acts of spoliation, which
          strip him of his property and reduce him to poverty. Hence he is
          often known as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Poor Man”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Poor Woman.”</span> Thus in the
          neighbourhood of Eisenach a small sheaf is sometimes left standing
          on the field for <span class="tei tei-q">“the Poor Old
          Woman.”</span><a id="noteref_1253" name="noteref_1253" href=

          Marksuhl, near Eisenach, the puppet formed out of the last sheaf is
          itself called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Poor Woman.”</span> At
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1254</span></span></a> In a
          village near Roeskilde, in Zealand (Denmark), old-fashioned
          peasants sometimes make up the last sheaf into a rude puppet, which
          is called the Rye-beggar.<a id="noteref_1255" name="noteref_1255"
          href="#note_1255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1255</span></span></a> In
          Southern Schonen the sheaf which is bound last is called the
          Beggar; it is made bigger than the rest and is sometimes dressed in
          clothes. In the district of Olmütz the last sheaf is called the
          Beggar; it is given to an old woman, who must carry it home,
          limping on one foot.<a id="noteref_1256" name="noteref_1256" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1256</span></span></a> Thus
          when the corn-spirit is conceived as a being who is robbed of his
          store and impoverished by the harvesters, it is natural that his
          representative—the passing stranger—should upbraid them; and it is
          equally natural that they should seek to disable him from pursuing
          them and recapturing the stolen property. Now, it is an old
          superstition that by easing nature on the spot where a robbery is
          committed, the robbers secure themselves, for a certain time,
          against interruption.<a id="noteref_1257" name="noteref_1257" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1257</span></span></a> The
          fact, therefore, that the madder-diggers resort to this proceeding
          in presence of the stranger proves that they consider themselves
          robbers and him as the person robbed. Regarded as such, he must be
          the natural owner of the madder-roots; that is, their spirit or
          demon; and this conception is carried out by burying him, like the
          madder-roots, in the ground.<a id="noteref_1258" name=

          Greeks, it may be observed, were quite familiar with the idea that
          a passing stranger may be a god. Homer says that the gods in the
          likeness of foreigners roam up and down cities.<a id="noteref_1259"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in these
          harvest-customs of modern Europe the person who cuts, binds, or
          threshes the last corn is treated as an embodiment of the
          corn-spirit by being wrapt up in sheaves, killed in mimicry by
          agricultural implements, and thrown into the water.<a id=

          These coincidences with the Lityerses story seem to prove that the
          latter is a genuine description of an old Phrygian harvest-custom.
          But since in the modern parallels the killing of the personal
          representative of the corn-spirit is necessarily omitted or at most
          enacted only in mimicry, it is necessary to show that in rude
          society human beings have been commonly killed as an agricultural
          ceremony to promote the fertility of the fields. The following
          examples will make this plain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Indians of

          Mexican harvest-festival, when the first-fruits of the season were
          offered to the sun, a criminal was placed between two immense
          stones, balanced opposite each other, and was crushed by them as
          they fell together. His remains were buried, and a feast and dance
          followed. This sacrifice was known as <span class="tei tei-q">“the

          Pawnees annually sacrificed a human victim in spring when they
          sowed their fields. The sacrifice was believed to have been
          enjoined on them by the Morning Star, or by a certain bird which
          the Morning <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg
          382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Star had sent to them as its messenger. The bird was stuffed and
          preserved as a powerful <span class="tei tei-q">“medicine.”</span>
          They thought that an omission of this sacrifice would be followed
          by the total failure of the crops of maize, beans, and pumpkins.
          The victim was a captive of either sex. He was clad in the gayest
          and most costly attire, was fattened on the choicest food, and
          carefully kept in ignorance of his doom. When he was fat enough,
          they bound him to a cross in the presence of the multitude, danced
          a solemn dance, then cleft his head with a tomahawk and shot him
          with arrows. According to one trader, the squaws then cut pieces of
          flesh from the victim's body, with which they greased their hoes;
          but this was denied by another trader who had been present at the
          ceremony. Immediately after the sacrifice the people proceeded to
          plant their fields. A particular account has been preserved of the
          sacrifice of a Sioux girl by the Pawnees in April 1837 or 1838. The
          girl had been kept for six months and well treated. Two days before
          the sacrifice she was led from wigwam to wigwam, accompanied by the
          whole council of chiefs and warriors. At each lodge she received a
          small billet of wood and a little paint, which she handed to the
          warrior next to her. In this way she called at every wigwam,
          receiving at each the same present of wood and paint. On the 22d of
          April she was taken out to be sacrificed, attended by the warriors,
          each of whom carried two pieces of wood which he had received from
          her hands. She was burned for some time over a slow fire, and then
          shot to death with arrows. The chief sacrificer next tore out her
          heart and devoured it. While her flesh was still warm it was cut in
          small pieces from the bones, put in little baskets, and taken to a
          neighbouring cornfield. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg

          Here the head chief took a piece of the flesh from a basket and
          squeezed a drop of blood upon the newly-deposited grains of corn.
          His example was followed by the rest, till all the seed had been
          sprinkled with the blood; it was then covered up with earth.<a id=

          heads of maize, and plantains, were hung on stakes on each side of
          her. The victims were bred up for the purpose in the king's

          necessary in the cultivation of turmeric, the Khonds arguing that
          the turmeric could not have a deep red colour without the shedding
          of blood.<a id="noteref_1271" name="noteref_1271" href=

          victim or Meriah was acceptable to the goddess only if he had been
          purchased, or had been born a victim—that is, the son of a victim
          father—or had been devoted as a child by his father or guardian.
          Khonds in distress often sold their children for victims,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“considering the beatification of their
          souls certain, and their death, for the benefit of mankind, the

          wished to marry. A party of Khonds, who saw this, immediately
          pressed forward to comfort the seller of his child, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Your child has died that all the world may

          victims were often kept for years before they were sacrificed.
          Being regarded as consecrated beings, they were treated with
          extreme affection, mingled with deference, and were welcomed
          wherever they went. A Meriah youth, on attaining maturity, was
          generally given a wife, who was herself usually a Meriah or victim;
          and with her he received a portion of land and farm-stock. Their
          offspring were also victims. Human sacrifices were offered to the
          Earth Goddess by tribes, branches of tribes, or villages, both at
          periodical festivals and on extraordinary occasions. The periodical
          sacrifices were generally so arranged by tribes and divisions of
          tribes that each head of a family was enabled, at least once a
          year, to procure a shred of flesh for his fields, generally about
          the time when his chief crop was laid down.<a id="noteref_1273"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mode of
          performing these tribal sacrifices was as follows. Ten or twelve
          days before the sacrifice, the victim was devoted by cutting off
          his hair, which, until then, was kept unshorn. Crowds of men and
          women assembled to witness the sacrifice; none might be excluded,
          since the sacrifice was declared to be <span class="tei tei-q">“for

          revelry and gross <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg

          the day before the sacrifice the victim, dressed in a new garment,
          was led forth from the village in solemn procession, with music and
          dancing, to the Meriah grove, which was a clump of high forest
          trees standing a little way from the village and untouched by the
          axe. In this grove the victim was tied to a post, which was
          sometimes placed between two plants of the sankissar shrub. He was
          then anointed with oil, ghee, and turmeric, and adorned with
          flowers; and <span class="tei tei-q">“a species of reverence, which
          it is not easy to distinguish from adoration,”</span> was paid to

          great struggle now arose to obtain the smallest relic from his
          person; a particle of the turmeric paste with which he was smeared,
          or a drop of his spittle, was esteemed of sovereign virtue,
          especially by the women. The crowd danced round the post to music,
          and, addressing the earth, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“O God, we

          night, were resumed, and continued till noon, when they ceased, and
          the assembly proceeded to consummate the sacrifice. The victim was
          again anointed with oil, and each person touched the anointed part,
          and wiped the oil on his own head. In some places the victim was
          then taken in procession round the village, from door to door,
          where some plucked hair from his head, and others begged for a drop
          of his spittle, with which they anointed their heads.<a id=

          the victim might not be bound nor make any show of resistance, the

          "Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bones of his arms
          and, if necessary, his legs were broken; but often this precaution
          was rendered unnecessary by stupefying him with opium.<a id=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1278</span></span></a> The
          mode of putting him to death varied in different places. One of the
          commonest modes seems to have been strangulation, or squeezing to
          death. The branch of a green tree was cleft several feet down the
          middle; the victim's neck (in other places, his chest) was inserted
          in the cleft, which the priest, aided by his assistants, strove
          with all his force to close.<a id="noteref_1279" name=
          "noteref_1279" href="#note_1279"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1279</span></span></a> Then
          he wounded the victim slightly with his axe, whereupon the crowd
          rushed at the victim and cut the flesh from the bones, leaving the
          head and bowels untouched. Sometimes he was cut up alive.<a id=
          "noteref_1280" name="noteref_1280" href="#note_1280"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1280</span></span></a> In
          Chinna Kimedy he was dragged along the fields, surrounded by the
          crowd, who, avoiding his head and intestines, hacked the flesh from
          his body with their knives till he died.<a id="noteref_1281" name=
          "noteref_1281" href="#note_1281"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1281</span></span></a>
          Another very common mode of sacrifice in the same district was to
          fasten the victim to the proboscis of a wooden elephant, which
          revolved on a stout post, and, as it whirled round, the crowd cut
          the flesh from the victim while life remained. In some villages
          Major Campbell found as many as fourteen of these wooden elephants,
          which had been used at sacrifices.<a id="noteref_1282" name=
          "noteref_1282" href="#note_1282"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1282</span></span></a> In
          one district the victim was put to death slowly by fire. A low
          stage was formed, sloping on either side like a roof; upon it
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name=
          "Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the victim was
          placed, his limbs wound round with cords to confine his struggles.
          Fires were then lighted and hot brands applied, to make him roll up
          and down the slopes of the stage as long as possible; for the more
          tears he shed the more abundant would be the supply of rain. Next
          day the body was cut to pieces.<a id="noteref_1283" name=
          "noteref_1283" href="#note_1283"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The flesh cut
          from the victim was instantly taken home by the persons who had
          been deputed by each village to bring it. To secure its rapid
          arrival, it was sometimes forwarded by relays of men, and conveyed
          with postal fleetness fifty or sixty miles.<a id="noteref_1284"
          name="noteref_1284" href="#note_1284"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1284</span></span></a> In
          each village all who stayed at home fasted rigidly until the flesh
          arrived. The bearer deposited it in the place of public assembly,
          where it was received by the priest and the heads of families. The
          priest divided it into two portions, one of which he offered to the
          Earth Goddess by burying it in a hole in the ground with his back
          turned, and without looking. Then each man added a little earth to
          bury it, and the priest poured water on the spot from a hill gourd.
          The other portion of flesh he divided into as many shares as there
          were heads of houses present. Each head of a house rolled his shred
          of flesh in leaves, and buried it in his favourite field, placing
          it in the earth behind his back without looking.<a id=
          "noteref_1285" name="noteref_1285" href="#note_1285"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1285</span></span></a> In
          some places each man carried his portion of flesh to the stream
          which watered his fields, and there hung it on a pole.<a id=
          "noteref_1286" name="noteref_1286" href="#note_1286"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1286</span></span></a> For
          three days thereafter no house was swept; and, in one district,
          strict silence was observed, no fire might be given out, no wood
          cut, and no strangers received. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> The remains of the human victim (namely, the
          head, bowels, and bones) were watched by strong parties the night
          after the sacrifice; and next morning they were burned, along with
          a whole sheep, on a funeral pile. The ashes were scattered over the
          fields, laid as paste over the houses and granaries, or mixed with
          the new corn to preserve it from insects.<a id="noteref_1287" name=

          Sometimes, however, the head and bones were buried, not
          burnt.<a id="noteref_1288" name="noteref_1288" href=

          After the suppression of the human sacrifices, inferior victims
          were substituted in some places; for instance, in the capital of
          Chinna Kimedy a goat took the place of a human victim.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these Khond
          sacrifices the Meriahs are represented by our authorities as
          victims offered to propitiate the Earth Goddess. But from the
          treatment of the victims both before and after death it appears
          that the custom cannot be explained as merely a propitiatory
          sacrifice. A part of the flesh certainly was offered to the Earth
          Goddess, but the rest of the flesh was buried by each householder
          in his fields, and the ashes of the other parts of the body were
          scattered over the fields, laid as paste on the granaries, or mixed
          with the new corn. These latter customs imply that to the body of
          the Meriah there was ascribed a direct or intrinsic power of making
          the crops to grow, quite independent of the indirect efficacy which
          it might have as an offering to secure the good-will of the deity.
          In other words, the flesh and ashes of the victim were believed to
          be endowed with a magical or physical power of fertilising the
          land. The same intrinsic power was ascribed to the blood and tears
          of the Meriah, his blood causing the redness of the turmeric and
          his tears <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg
          390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          producing rain; for it can hardly be doubted that, originally at
          least, the tears were supposed to produce rain, not merely to
          prognosticate it. Similarly the custom of pouring water on the
          buried flesh of the Meriah was no doubt a rain-charm. Again,
          intrinsic supernatural power as an attribute of the Meriah appears
          in the sovereign virtue believed to reside in anything that came
          from his person, as his hair or spittle. The ascription of such
          power to the Meriah indicates that he was much more than a mere man
          sacrificed to propitiate a deity. Once more, the extreme reverence
          paid him points to the same conclusion. Major Campbell speaks of
          the Meriah as <span class="tei tei-q">“being regarded as something
          more than mortal,”</span><a id="noteref_1290" name="noteref_1290"
          href="#note_1290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1290</span></span></a> and
          Major Macpherson says, <span class="tei tei-q">“A species of
          reverence, which it is not easy to distinguish from adoration, is
          paid to him.”</span><a id="noteref_1291" name="noteref_1291" href=
          "#note_1291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1291</span></span></a> In
          short, the Meriah appears to have been regarded as divine. As such,
          he may originally have represented the Earth deity or perhaps a
          deity of vegetation; though in later times he came to be regarded
          rather as a victim offered to a deity than as himself an incarnate
          deity. This later view of the Meriah as a victim rather than a god
          may perhaps have received undue emphasis from the European writers
          who have described the Khond religion. Habituated to the later idea
          of sacrifice as an offering made to a god for the purpose of
          conciliating his favour, European observers are apt to interpret
          all religious slaughter in this sense, and to suppose that wherever
          such slaughter takes place, there must necessarily be a deity to
          whom the slaughter is believed by the slayers to be acceptable.
          Thus their preconceived ideas unconsciously colour and warp their
          descriptions of savage rites.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same custom
          of killing the representative of a god, of which strong traces
          appear in the Khond sacrifices, may perhaps be detected in some of
          the other human sacrifices described above. Thus the ashes of the
          slaughtered Marimo were scattered over the fields; the blood of the
          Brahman lad was put on the crop and field; and the blood of the
          Sioux girl was allowed to trickle on the seed.<a id="noteref_1292"
          name="noteref_1292" href="#note_1292"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1292</span></span></a>
          Again, the identification of the victim with the corn, in other
          words, the view that he is an embodiment or spirit of the corn, is
          brought out in the pains which seem to be taken to secure a
          physical correspondence between him and the natural object which he
          embodies or represents. Thus the Mexicans killed young victims for
          the young corn and old ones for the ripe corn; the Marimos
          sacrifice, as <span class="tei tei-q">“seed,”</span> a short, fat
          man, the shortness of his stature corresponding to that of the
          young corn, his fatness to the condition which it is desired that
          the crops may attain; and the Pawnees fattened their victims
          probably with the same view. Again, the identification of the
          victim with the corn comes out in the African custom of killing him
          with spades and hoes, and the Mexican custom of grinding him, like
          corn, between two stones.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One more point
          in these savage customs deserves to be noted. The Pawnee chief
          devoured the heart of the Sioux girl, and the Marimos and Gonds ate
          the victim's flesh. If, as we suppose, the victim was regarded as
          divine, it follows that in eating his flesh his worshippers were
          partaking of the body of their god. To this point we shall return
          later on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The savage rites
          just described offer analogies to the harvest customs of Europe.
          Thus the fertilising <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg
          392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          virtue ascribed to the corn-spirit is shown equally in the savage
          custom of mixing the victim's blood or ashes with the seed-corn and
          the European custom of mixing the grain from the last sheaf with
          the young corn in spring.<a id="noteref_1293" name="noteref_1293"
          href="#note_1293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1293</span></span></a>
          Again, the identification of the person with the corn appears alike
          in the savage custom of adapting the age and stature of the victim
          to the age and stature (actual or expected) of the crop; in the
          Scotch and Styrian rules that when the corn-spirit is conceived as
          the Maiden the last corn shall be cut by a young maiden, but when
          it is conceived as the Corn-mother it shall be cut by an old
          woman;<a id="noteref_1294" name="noteref_1294" href=
          "#note_1294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1294</span></span></a> in
          the Lothringian warning given to old women to save themselves when
          the Old Woman is being killed, that is, when the last corn is being
          threshed;<a id="noteref_1295" name="noteref_1295" href=
          "#note_1295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1295</span></span></a> and
          in the Tyrolese expectation that if the man who gives the last
          stroke at threshing is tall, the next year's corn will be tall
          also.<a id="noteref_1296" name="noteref_1296" href=
          "#note_1296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1296</span></span></a>
          Further, the same identification is implied in the savage custom of
          killing the representative of the corn-spirit with hoes or spades
          or by grinding him between stones, and in the European custom of
          pretending to kill him with the scythe or the flail. Once more the
          Khond custom of pouring water on the buried flesh of the victim is
          parallel to the European customs of pouring water on the personal
          representative of the corn-spirit or plunging him into a
          stream.<a id="noteref_1297" name="noteref_1297" href=
          "#note_1297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1297</span></span></a> Both
          the Khond and the European customs are rain-charms.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To return now to
          the Lityerses story. It has been shown that in rude society human
          beings have been commonly killed to promote the growth of the
          crops. There is therefore no improbability in the supposition that
          they may once have been killed for a like purpose <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in Phrygia and Europe; and when
          Phrygian legend and European folk-custom, closely agreeing with
          each other, point to the conclusion that men were so slain, we are
          bound, provisionally at least, to accept the conclusion. Further,
          both the Lityerses story and European harvest customs agree in
          indicating that the person slain was slain as a representative of
          the corn-spirit, and this indication is in harmony with the view
          which savages appear to take of the victim slain to make the crops
          flourish. On the whole, then, we may fairly suppose that both in
          Phrygia and in Europe the representative of the corn-spirit was
          annually killed upon the harvest-field. Grounds have been already
          shown for believing that similarly in Europe the representative of
          the tree-spirit was annually slain. The proofs of these two
          remarkable and closely analogous customs are entirely independent
          of each other. Their coincidence seems to furnish fresh presumption
          in favour of both.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the question,
          how was the representative of the corn-spirit chosen? one answer
          has been already given. Both the Lityerses story and European
          folk-custom show that passing strangers were regarded as
          manifestations of the corn-spirit escaping from the cut or threshed
          corn, and as such were seized and slain. But this is not the only
          answer which the evidence suggests. According to one version of the
          Phrygian legend the victims of Lityerses were not passing strangers
          but persons whom he had vanquished in a reaping contest; and though
          it is not said that he killed, but only that he thrashed them, we
          can hardly avoid supposing that in one version of the story the
          vanquished reapers, like the strangers in the other version, were
          said to have been wrapt up by Lityerses in corn-sheaves and so
          beheaded. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg
          394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          supposition is countenanced by European harvest-customs. We have
          seen that in Europe there is sometimes a contest amongst the
          reapers to avoid being last, and that the person who is vanquished
          in this competition, that is, who cuts the last corn, is often
          roughly handled. It is true we have not found that a pretence is
          made of killing him; but on the other hand we have found that a
          pretence is made of killing the man who gives the last stroke at
          threshing, that is, who is vanquished in the threshing
          contest.<a id="noteref_1298" name="noteref_1298" href=
          "#note_1298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1298</span></span></a> Now,
          since it is in the character of representative of the corn-spirit
          that the thresher of the last corn is slain in mimicry, and since
          the same representative character attaches (as we have seen) to the
          cutter and binder as well as to the thresher of the last corn, and
          since the same repugnance is evinced by harvesters to be last in
          any one of these labours, we may conjecture that a pretence has
          been commonly made of killing the reaper and binder as well as the
          thresher of the last corn, and that in ancient times this killing
          was actually carried out. This conjecture is corroborated by the
          common superstition that whoever cuts the last corn must die
          soon.<a id="noteref_1299" name="noteref_1299" href=

          Sometimes it is thought that the person who binds the last sheaf on
          the field will die in the course of next year.<a id="noteref_1300"
          name="noteref_1300" href="#note_1300"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1300</span></span></a> The
          reason for fixing on the reaper, binder, or thresher of the last
          corn as the representative of the corn-spirit may be this. The
          corn-spirit is supposed to lurk as long as he can in the corn,
          retreating before the reapers, the binders, and the threshers at
          their work. But when he is forcibly expelled from his ultimate
          refuge in the last corn cut or the last sheaf bound or the last
          grain threshed, he necessarily assumes some other form than
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name=
          "Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that of the
          corn-stalks which had hitherto been his garments or body. And what
          form can the expelled corn-spirit assume more naturally than that
          of the person who stands nearest to the corn from which he (the
          corn-spirit) has just been expelled? But the person in question is
          necessarily the reaper, binder, or thresher of the last corn. He or
          she, therefore, is seized and treated as the corn-spirit
          himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the person
          who was killed on the harvest-field as the representative of the
          corn-spirit may have been either a passing stranger or the
          harvester who was last at reaping, binding, or threshing. But there
          is a third possibility, to which ancient legend and modern
          folk-custom alike point. Lityerses not only put strangers to death;
          he was himself slain, and probably in the same way as he had slain
          others, namely, by being wrapt in a corn-sheaf, beheaded, and cast
          into the river; and it is implied that this happened to Lityerses
          on his own land. Similarly in modern harvest-customs the pretence
          of killing appears to be carried out quite as often on the person
          of the master (farmer or squire) as on that of strangers.<a id=
          "noteref_1301" name="noteref_1301" href="#note_1301"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1301</span></span></a> Now
          when we remember that Lityerses was said to have been the son of
          the King of Phrygia, and combine with this the tradition that he
          was put to death, apparently as a representative of the
          corn-spirit, we are led to conjecture that we have here another
          trace of the custom of annually slaying one of those divine or
          priestly kings who are known to have held ghostly sway in many
          parts of Western Asia and particularly in Phrygia. The custom
          appears, as we have seen,<a id="noteref_1302" name="noteref_1302"
          href="#note_1302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1302</span></span></a> to
          have been so far modified in places that the king's son was slain
          in the king's stead. Of the custom thus <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> modified the story of Lityerses would
          therefore be a reminiscence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turning now to
          the relation of the Phrygian Lityerses to the Phrygian Attis, it
          may be remembered that at Pessinus—the seat of a priestly
          kingship—the high-priest appears to have been annually slain in the
          character of Attis, a god of vegetation, and that Attis was
          described by an ancient authority as <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          reaped ear of corn.”</span><a id="noteref_1303" name="noteref_1303"
          href="#note_1303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1303</span></span></a> Thus
          Attis, as an embodiment of the corn-spirit, annually slain in the
          person of his representative, might be thought to be ultimately
          identical with Lityerses, the latter being simply the rustic
          prototype out of which the state religion of Attis was developed.
          It may have been so; but, on the other hand, the analogy of
          European folk-custom warns us that amongst the same people two
          distinct deities of vegetation may have their separate personal
          representatives, both of whom are slain in the character of gods at
          different times of the year. For in Europe, as we have seen, it
          appears that one man was commonly slain in the character of the
          tree-spirit in spring, and another in the character of the
          corn-spirit in autumn. It may have been so in Phrygia also. Attis
          was especially a tree-god, and his connection with corn may have
          been only such an extension of the power of a tree-spirit as is
          indicated in customs like the Harvest-May.<a id="noteref_1304"
          name="noteref_1304" href="#note_1304"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1304</span></span></a>
          Again, the representative of Attis appears to have been slain in
          spring; whereas Lityerses must have been slain in summer or autumn,
          according to the time of the harvest in Phrygia.<a id=
          "noteref_1305" name="noteref_1305" href="#note_1305"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1305</span></span></a> On
          the whole, then, while we are not justified in regarding
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a name=
          "Pg397" id="Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Lityerses as the
          prototype of Attis, the two may be regarded as parallel products of
          the same religious idea, and may have stood to each other as in
          Europe the Old Man of harvest stands to the Wild Man, the Leaf Man,
          etc., of spring. Both were spirits or deities of vegetation, and
          the personal representatives of both were annually slain. But
          whereas the Attis worship became elevated into the dignity of a
          state religion and spread to Italy, the rites of Lityerses seem
          never to have passed the limits of their native Phrygia, and always
          retained their character of rustic ceremonies performed by peasants
          on the harvest-field. At most a few villages may have clubbed
          together, as amongst the Khonds, to procure a human victim to be
          slain as representative of the corn-spirit for their common
          benefit. Such victims may have been drawn from the families of
          priestly kings or kinglets, which would account for the legendary
          character of Lityerses as the son of a Phrygian king. When villages
          did not so club together, each village or farm may have procured
          its own representative of the corn-spirit by dooming to death
          either a passing stranger or the harvester who cut, bound, or
          threshed the last sheaf. It is hardly necessary to add that in
          Phrygia, as in Europe, the old barbarous custom of killing a man on
          the harvest-field or the threshing-floor had doubtless passed into
          a mere pretence long before the classical era, and was probably
          regarded by the reapers and threshers themselves as no more than a
          rough jest which the license of a harvest-home permitted them to
          play off on a passing stranger, a comrade, or even on their master
          himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have dwelt on
          the Lityerses song at length because it affords so many points of
          comparison with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg
          398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          European and savage folk-custom. The other harvest songs of Western
          Asia and Egypt, to which attention has been called above,<a id=
          "noteref_1306" name="noteref_1306" href="#note_1306"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1306</span></span></a> may
          now be dismissed much more briefly. The similarity of the Bithynian
          Bormus<a id="noteref_1307" name="noteref_1307" href=
          "#note_1307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1307</span></span></a> to
          the Phrygian Lityerses helps to bear out the interpretation which
          has been given of the latter. Bormus, whose death or rather
          disappearance was annually mourned by the reapers in a plaintive
          song, was, like Lityerses, a king's son or at least the son of a
          wealthy and distinguished man. The reapers whom he watched were at
          work on his own fields, and he disappeared in going to fetch water
          for them; according to one version of the story he was carried off
          by the (water) nymphs.<a id="noteref_1308" name="noteref_1308"
          href="#note_1308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1308</span></span></a>
          Viewed in the light of the Lityerses story and of European
          folk-custom, this disappearance of Bormus is probably a
          reminiscence of the custom of binding the farmer himself in a
          corn-sheaf and throwing him into the water. The mournful strain
          which the reapers sang was probably a lamentation over the death of
          the corn-spirit, slain either in the cut corn or in the person of a
          human representative; and the call which they addressed to him may
          have been a prayer that the corn-spirit might return in fresh
          vigour next year.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Phoenician
          Linus song was sung at the vintage, at least in the west of Asia
          Minor, as we learn from Homer; and this, combined with the legend
          of Syleus, suggests that in ancient times passing strangers were
          handled by vintagers and vine-diggers in much the same way as they
          are said to have been handled by the reaper Lityerses. The Lydian
          Syleus, so ran the legend, compelled passers-by to dig for him in
          his vineyard, till Hercules came and killed him and dug
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1309</span></span></a> This
          seems to be the outline of a legend like that of Lityerses; but
          neither ancient writers nor modern folk-custom enable us to fill in
          the details.<a id="noteref_1310" name="noteref_1310" href=
          "#note_1310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1310</span></span></a> But,
          further, the Linus song was probably sung also by Phoenician
          reapers, for Herodotus compares it to the Maneros song, which, as
          we have seen, was a lament raised by Egyptian reapers over the cut
          corn. Further, Linus was identified with Adonis, and Adonis has
          some claims to be regarded as especially a corn-deity.<a id=
          "noteref_1311" name="noteref_1311" href="#note_1311"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1311</span></span></a> Thus
          the Linus lament, as sung at harvest, would be identical with the
          Adonis lament; each would be the lamentation raised by reapers over
          the dead corn-spirit. But whereas Adonis, like Attis, grew into a
          stately figure of mythology, adored and mourned in splendid cities
          far beyond the limits of his Phoenician home, Linus appears to have
          remained a simple ditty sung by reapers and vintagers among the
          corn-sheaves and the vines. The analogy of Lityerses and of
          folk-custom, both European and savage, suggests that in Phoenicia
          the slain corn-spirit—the dead Adonis—may formerly have been
          represented by a human victim; and this suggestion is possibly
          supported by the Harrân legend that Thammuz (Adonis) was slain by
          his cruel lord, who ground his bones in a mill and scattered them
          to the wind.<a id="noteref_1312" name="noteref_1312" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1312</span></span></a> For
          in Mexico, as we have seen, the human victim at harvest was crushed
          between two stones; and both in India and Africa the ashes of the
          victim were scattered over the fields.<a id="noteref_1313" name=
          "noteref_1313" href="#note_1313"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1313</span></span></a> But
          the Harrân legend may be only a mythical way of expressing the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name=
          "Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> grinding of corn in
          the mill and the scattering of the seed. It seems worth suggesting
          that the mock king who was annually killed at the Babylonian
          festival of the Sacaea on the 16th of the month Lous may have
          represented Thammuz himself. For the historian Berosus, who records
          the festival and its date, probably used the Macedonian calendar,
          since he dedicated his history to Antiochus Soter; and in his day
          the Macedonian month Lous appears to have corresponded to the
          Babylonian month Thammuz.<a id="noteref_1314" name="noteref_1314"

          this conjecture is right, the view that the mock king at the Sacaea
          was slain in the character of a god would be established.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a good
          deal more evidence that in Egypt the slain corn-spirit—the dead
          Osiris—was represented by a human victim, whom the reapers slew on
          the harvest-field, mourning his death in a dirge, to which the
          Greeks, through a verbal misunderstanding, gave the name of
          Maneros.<a id="noteref_1315" name="noteref_1315" href=

          the legend of Busiris seems to preserve a reminiscence of human
          sacrifices once offered by the Egyptians in connection with the
          worship of Osiris. Busiris was said to have been an Egyptian king
          who sacrificed all strangers on the altar of Zeus. The origin of
          the custom was traced to a barrenness which afflicted the land of
          Egypt for nine years. A Cyprian seer informed Busiris that the
          barrenness would cease if a man were annually sacrificed
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name=
          "Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to Zeus. So Busiris
          instituted the sacrifice. But when Hercules came to Egypt, and was
          being dragged to the altar to be sacrificed, he burst his bonds and
          slew Busiris and his son.<a id="noteref_1316" name="noteref_1316"
          href="#note_1316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1316</span></span></a> Here
          then is a legend that in Egypt a human victim was annually
          sacrificed to prevent the failure of the crops, and a belief is
          implied that an omission of the sacrifice would have entailed a
          recurrence of that infertility which it was the object of the
          sacrifice to prevent. So the Pawnees, as we have seen, believed
          that an omission of the human sacrifice at planting would have been
          followed by a total failure of their crops. The name Busiris was in
          reality the name of a city, <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1317</span></span></a> the
          city being so called because it contained the grave of Osiris. The
          human sacrifices were said to have been offered at his grave, and
          the victims were red-haired men, whose ashes were scattered abroad
          by means of winnowing-fans.<a id="noteref_1318" name="noteref_1318"
          href="#note_1318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          the light of the foregoing discussion, this Egyptian tradition
          admits of a consistent and fairly probable explanation. Osiris, the
          corn-spirit, was annually represented at harvest by a stranger,
          whose red hair made him a suitable representative of the ripe corn.
          This man, in his representative character, was slain on the
          harvest-field, and mourned by the reapers, who prayed at the same
          time that the corn-spirit might revive and return (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mââ-ne-rha</span></span>, Maneros) with
          renewed vigour in the following year. Finally, the victim, or some
          part of him, was burned, and the ashes scattered by winnowing-fans
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name=
          "Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> over the fields to
          fertilise them. Here the choice of the representative on the ground
          of his resemblance to the corn which he was to represent agrees
          with the Mexican and African customs already described.<a id=
          "noteref_1319" name="noteref_1319" href="#note_1319"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1319</span></span></a>
          Similarly the Romans sacrificed red-haired puppies in spring, in
          the belief that the crops would thus grow ripe and ruddy;<a id=
          "noteref_1320" name="noteref_1320" href="#note_1320"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1320</span></span></a> and
          to this day in sowing wheat a Bavarian sower will sometimes wear a
          golden ring, that the corn may grow yellow.<a id="noteref_1321"
          name="noteref_1321" href="#note_1321"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1321</span></span></a>
          Again, the scattering of the Egyptian victim's ashes is identical
          with the Marimo and Khond custom.<a id="noteref_1322" name=

          identification with the corn comes out again in the fact that his
          ashes were winnowed; just as in Vendée a pretence is made of
          threshing and winnowing the farmer's wife, regarded as an
          embodiment of the corn-spirit; or as in Mexico the victim was
          ground between stones; or as in Africa he was slain with spades and
          hoes.<a id="noteref_1323" name="noteref_1323" href=

          story that the fragments of Osiris's body were scattered up and
          down the land, and buried by Isis on the spots where they
          lay,<a id="noteref_1324" name="noteref_1324" href=
          "#note_1324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1324</span></span></a> may
          very well be a reminiscence of a custom, like that observed by the
          Khonds, of dividing the human victim in pieces and burying the
          pieces, often at intervals of many miles from each other, in the
          fields. However, it is possible that the story of the dismemberment
          of Osiris, like the similar story told of Thammuz, may have been
          simply a mythical expression for the scattering of the seed. Once
          more, the story that the body of Osiris enclosed in a coffer was
          thrown by Typhon into the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg
          403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Nile perhaps points to a custom of throwing the body of the victim,
          or at least a portion of it, into the Nile as a rain-charm, or
          rather to make the Nile rise. For a similar purpose Phrygian
          reapers seem to have thrown the headless bodies of their victims,
          wrapt in corn-sheaves, into a river, and the Khonds poured water on
          the buried flesh of the human victim. Probably when Osiris ceased
          to be represented by a human victim, an effigy of him was annually
          thrown into the Nile, just as the effigy of his Syrian counterpart,
          Adonis, used to be thrown into the sea at Alexandria. Or water may
          have been simply poured over it, as on the monument already
          mentioned a priest is seen pouring water over the body of Osiris,
          from which corn stalks are sprouting. The accompanying inscription,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“This is Osiris of the mysteries, who
          springs from the returning waters,”</span> bears out the view that
          at the mysteries of Osiris a water-charm or irrigation-charm was
          regularly performed by pouring water on his effigy, or by throwing
          it into the Nile.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
          objected that the red-haired victims were slain as representatives
          not of Osiris, but of his enemy Typhon; for the victims were called
          Typhonian, and red was the colour of Typhon, black the colour of
          Osiris.<a id="noteref_1325" name="noteref_1325" href=
          "#note_1325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1325</span></span></a> The
          answer to this objection must be reserved for the present. Meantime
          it may be pointed out that if Osiris is often represented on the
          monuments as black, he is still more commonly depicted as
          green,<a id="noteref_1326" name="noteref_1326" href=
          "#note_1326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1326</span></span></a>
          appropriately enough for a corn-god, who may be conceived as black
          while the seed is under ground, but as green after it has sprouted.
          So the Greeks recognised <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg
          404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          both a green and a black Demeter,<a id="noteref_1327" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1327</span></span></a> and
          sacrificed to the green Demeter in spring with mirth and
          gladness.<a id="noteref_1328" name="noteref_1328" href=
          "#note_1328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, if I am
          right, the key to the mysteries of Osiris is furnished by the
          melancholy cry of the Egyptian reapers, which down to Roman times
          could be heard year after year sounding across the fields,
          announcing the death of the corn-spirit, the rustic prototype of
          Osiris. Similar cries, as we have seen, were also heard on all the
          harvest-fields of Western Asia. By the ancients they are spoken of
          as songs; but to judge from the analysis of the names Linus and
          Maneros, they probably consisted only of a few words uttered in a
          prolonged musical note which could be heard for a great distance.
          Such sonorous and long-drawn cries, raised by a number of strong
          voices in concert, must have had a striking effect, and could
          hardly fail to arrest the attention of any traveller who happened
          to be within hearing. The sounds, repeated again and again, could
          probably be distinguished with tolerable ease even at a distance;
          but to a Greek traveller in Asia or Egypt the foreign words would
          commonly convey no meaning, and he might take them, not
          unnaturally, for the name of some one (Maneros, Linos, Lityerses,
          Bormus), upon whom the reapers were calling. And if his journey led
          him through more countries than one, as Bithynia and Phrygia, or
          Phoenicia and Egypt, while the corn was being reaped, he would have
          an opportunity of comparing the various harvest cries of the
          different peoples. Thus we can readily account for the fact that
          these harvest cries were so often noted and compared with each
          other by the Greeks. Whereas, if they had been <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> regular songs, they could not have been
          heard at such distances, and therefore could not have attracted the
          attention of so many travellers; and, moreover, even if the
          traveller were within hearing of them, he could not so easily have
          picked out the words. To this day Devonshire reapers utter cries of
          the same sort, and perform on the field a ceremony exactly
          analogous to that in which, if I am not mistaken, the rites of
          Osiris originated. The cry and the ceremony are thus described by
          an observer who wrote in the first half of this century.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“After the wheat is all cut, on most farms
          in the north of Devon, the harvest people have a custom of
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘crying the neck.’</span> I believe that
          this practice is seldom omitted on any large farm in that part of
          the country. It is done in this way. An old man, or some one else
          well acquainted with the ceremonies used on the occasion (when the
          labourers are reaping the last field of wheat), goes round to the
          shocks and sheaves, and picks out a little bundle of all the best
          ears he can find; this bundle he ties up very neat and trim, and
          plats and arranges the straws very tastefully. This is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span> of wheat, or
          wheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and the pitcher once more
          circulated, the reapers, binders, and the women, stand round in a
          circle. The person with <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span>
          stands in the centre, grasping it with both his hands. He first
          stoops and holds it near the ground, and all the men forming the
          ring take off their hats, stooping and holding them with both hands
          towards the ground. They then all begin at once in a very prolonged
          and harmonious tone to cry <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
          neck!’</span> at the same time slowly raising themselves upright,
          and elevating their arms and hats above their heads; the person
          with <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span> also raising it on
          high. This is done three times. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> They then change their cry to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘wee yen!’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘way
          yen!’</span>—which they sound in the same prolonged and slow manner
          as before, with singular harmony and effect, three times. This last
          cry is accompanied by the same movements of the body and arms as in
          crying <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck.’</span>... After having
          thus repeated <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span> three
          times, and <span class="tei tei-q">‘wee yen,’</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘way yen,’</span> as often, they all burst
          out into a kind of loud and joyous laugh, flinging up their hats
          and caps into the air, capering about and perhaps kissing the
          girls. One of them then gets <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
          neck’</span> and runs as hard as he can down to the farmhouse,
          where the dairymaid or one of the young female domestics stands at
          the door prepared with a pail of water. If he who holds
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the neck’</span> can manage to get into
          the house, in any way unseen, or openly, by any other way than the
          door at which the girl stands with the pail of water, then he may
          lawfully kiss her; but, if otherwise, he is regularly soused with
          the contents of the bucket. On a fine still autumn evening, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘crying of the neck’</span> has a wonderful
          effect at a distance, far finer than that of the Turkish muezzin,
          which Lord Byron eulogises so much, and which he says is preferable
          to all the bells in Christendom. I have once or twice heard upwards
          of twenty men cry it, and sometimes joined by an equal number of
          female voices. About three years back, on some high grounds, where
          our people were harvesting, I heard six or seven <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘necks’</span> cried in one night, although I know that
          some of them were four miles off. They are heard through the quiet
          evening air, at a considerable distance sometimes.”</span><a id=

          Again, Mrs. Bray tells how, travelling in Devonshire, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“she saw a party of reapers standing in a circle on a
          rising ground, holding <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg
          407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          their sickles aloft. One in the middle held up some ears of corn
          tied together with flowers, and the party shouted three times (what
          she writes as) <span class="tei tei-q">‘Arnack, arnack, arnack, we

          accompanied by women and children carrying boughs of flowers,
          shouting and singing. The man-servant who attended Mrs. Bray, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘it was only the people making their games,
          as they always did, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          generally hung up in the farmhouse, where it sometimes remains for

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1331</span></span></a> A
          similar custom is still observed in some parts of Cornwall, as I am
          informed by my friend Professor J. H. Middleton. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The last sheaf is decked with ribbons. Two
          strong-voiced men are chosen and placed (one with the sheaf) on

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘I'se gotten the neck.’</span> ”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
          Devonshire and Cornish customs a particular bunch of ears,

          conceived as the neck of the corn-spirit, who is consequently
          beheaded when the bunch is cut down. Similarly in Shropshire the
          name <span class="tei tei-q">“neck,”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the gander's neck,”</span> used to be commonly given
          to the last handful of ears left standing in the middle of the
          field, when all the rest of the corn was cut. It was plaited
          together, and the reapers, standing ten or twenty paces off, threw
          their sickles at it. Whoever cut it through was said to have cut
          off the gander's neck. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg

          and Cornish expression <span class="tei tei-q">“the neck,”</span>
          as applied to the last sheaf. The corn-spirit is conceived in human
          or animal form, and the last standing corn is part of its body—its
          neck, its head, or its tail. Sometimes, as we have seen, it is
          regarded as the navel-string.<a id="noteref_1339" name=

          Lastly, the Devonshire custom of drenching with water the person
          who brings in <span class="tei tei-q">“the neck”</span> is a
          rain-charm, such as we have had many examples of. Its parallel in
          the mysteries of Osiris was the custom of pouring water on the
          image of Osiris or on the person who represented him.</p>

          failing to find the soul in the head-doctor's box it occurs to them
          that he may have swallowed it, as the other doctors were at first
          supposed to have done. With a view of testing this hypothesis they
          hold him up by the heels to empty out the soul; and as the water
          with which his head is washed may possibly contain the missing
          soul, it is poured on the patient's head to restore the soul to
          him. We have already seen that the recovered soul is often conveyed
          into the sick person's head.</dd>

          Chrysostom, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>
          (vol. i. p. 76, ed. Dindorf). Dio Chrysostom does not mention his
          authority, but it was probably either Berosus or Ctesias. Though
          the execution of the mock king is not mentioned in the passage of
          Berosus cited by Athenaeus, the omission is probably due to the
          fact that the mention of it was not germane to Athenaeus's purpose,
          which was simply to give a list of festivals at which masters
          waited on their servants. That the ζωγάνης was put to death is
          further shown by Macrobius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">zanas</span></span> we should probably read
          ζωγάνας with Liebrecht, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          appears from our authorities, does not date from before the Persian
          domination in Babylon; but probably it was much older. In the
          passage of Dio Chrysostom ἐκρέμασαν should be translated
          <span class="tei tei-q">“crucified”</span> (or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“impaled”</span>), not <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“hung.”</span> It is strange that this, the regular,
          sense of κρεμάννυμι, as applied to executions, should not be
          noticed even in the latest edition of Liddell and Scott's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek
          Lexicon</span></span>. Hanging, though a mode of suicide, was not a
          mode of execution in antiquity either in the east or west. In one
          of the passages cited by L. and S. for the sense <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to hang”</span> (Plutarch, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Caes.</span></span>
          2), the context proves that the meaning is <span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">In the Alexandrian year the month
          Athyr corresponded to November. But as the old Egyptian year was
          vague, that is, made no use of intercalation, the astronomical date
          of each festival varied from year to year, till it had passed
          through the whole cycle of the astronomical year. From the fact,
          therefore, that, when the calendar became fixed, Athyr fell in
          November, no inference can be drawn as to the date at which the
          death of Osiris was originally celebrated. It is thus perfectly
          possible that it may have been originally a harvest festival,
          though the Egyptian harvest falls, not in November, but in April;

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are far
            more plausible grounds for identifying Osiris with the moon than
            with the sun—1. He was said to have lived or reigned twenty-eight
            years; Plutarch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Isis et Osiris</span></span>, cc. 13, 42.
            This might be taken as a mythical expression for a lunar month.
            2. His body was rent into fourteen pieces (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ib.</span></span>
            cc. 18, 42). This might be interpreted of the moon on the wane,
            losing a piece of itself on each of the fourteen days which make
            up the second half of a lunation. It is expressly mentioned that
            Typhon found the body of Osiris at the full moon (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ib.</span></span>
            8); thus the dismemberment of the god would begin with the waning
            of the moon. 3. In a hymn supposed to be addressed by Isis to
            Osiris, it is said that Thoth</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Placeth thy soul in the bark Ma-at,<br />

            Moon</span></span>.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And again,</p>

            We do not cease to contemplate thee,<br />
            Thine emanation heightens the brilliancy<br />

            Here then Osiris is identified with the moon in set terms. If in
            the same hymn he is said to <span class="tei tei-q">“illuminate
            us like Ra”</span> (the sun), this, as we have already seen, is
            no reason for identifying him with the sun, but quite the
            contrary. 4. At the new moon of the month Phanemoth, being the
            beginning of spring, the Egyptians celebrated what they called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the entry of Osiris into the
            moon.”</span> Plutarch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Is. et Os.</span></span> 43. 5. The bull
            Apis, which was regarded as an image of the soul of Osiris
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Is. et
            Os.</span></span> cc. 20, 29), was born of a cow which was
            believed to have been impregnated by the moon (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ib.</span></span>
            43). 6. Once a year, at the full moon, pigs were sacrificed
            simultaneously to the moon and Osiris. Herodotus, ii. 47;
            Plutarch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Is. et Os.</span></span> 8. The relation of
            the pig to Osiris will be examined later on.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without
            attempting to explain in detail why a god of vegetation, as I
            take Osiris to have been, should have been brought into such
            close connection with the moon, I may refer to the intimate
            relation which is vulgarly believed to subsist between the growth
            of vegetation and the phases of the moon. See <span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is possible that a ceremony
          performed in a Cyprian worship of Ariadne may have been of this
          nature. Plutarch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Theseus</span></span>, 20, ἐν δὴ τῇ θυσίᾳ τοῦ

          φθέγγεσθαι καὶ ποιεῖν ἄπερ ὠδινοῦσαι γυναῖκες. We have already seen
          grounds for regarding Ariadne as a goddess or spirit of vegetation
          (above, p. 104). If, however, the reference is to the
          Syro-Macedonian calendar, in which Gorpiaeus corresponds to
          September (Daremberg et Saglio, i. 831), the ceremony could not
          have been a harvest celebration, but may have been a vintage one.
          Amongst the Minnitarees in North America, the Prince of Neuwied saw
          a tall strong woman pretend to bring up a stalk of maize out of her
          stomach; the object of the ceremony was to secure a good crop of
          maize in the following year. Maximilian, Prinz zu Wied,

          In Greece the annual descent of Proserpine appears to have taken

          "tei tei-q">‘Goigote’</span>—the tying of the cultivator's knot.
          When a sheaf of corn has been threshed out, before it is removed
          the grain is heaped up and the threshers, generally six in number,
          sit round it, and taking a few stalks, with the ears of corn
          attached, jointly tie a knot and bury it in the heap. It is left
          there until all the sheaves have been threshed and the corn
          winnowed and measured. The object of this ceremony is to prevent
          the devils from diminishing the quantity of corn in the
          heap.”</span> C. J. R. Le Mesurier, <span class=

          called the Rush-cutter used to be much dreaded. On the morning of
          St. John's Day he was wont to walk through the fields with sickles
          tied to his ankles cutting avenues in the corn as he walked. To
          detect him, seven bundles of brushwood were silently threshed with
          the flail on the threshing-floor, and the stranger who appeared at
          the door of the barn during the threshing was the Rush-cutter.

            which, like most rationalistic explanations of folk-custom, would
            be wrong, it may be pointed out that a little of the crop is
            sometimes left on the field for the spirit under other names than
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Poor Old Woman.”</span> Thus in a
            village of the Tilsit district, the last sheaf was left standing
            on the field <span class="tei tei-q">“for the Old
            Rye-woman.”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            (Canton of Zürich) the first three ears of corn reaped are thrown

            Corn-mother and to make the next year's crop abundant.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“it belongs to the Old Woman,”</span> to

            In Russia a patch of unreaped corn is left in the field and the
            ears are knotted together; this is called <span class=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“The unreaped patch is looked upon as
            tabooed; and it is believed that if any one meddles with it he
            will shrivel up, and become twisted like the interwoven
            ears.”</span> Ralston, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Babylon? I think it was, and one month different, at least in the
          early times of the Greek monarchy in Asia. For we know from a
          Babylonian observation in the Almagest (<span class=

          I. 396) that in 229 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          February 26. It was therefore the month before the equinoctial
          moon, not Nisan but Adar, and consequently Lous answered to the
          lunar month Tammuz.”</span></dd>

              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The

              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
